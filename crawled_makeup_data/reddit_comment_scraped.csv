The first picture was taken in January 2020, at my dermatologist’s clinic after a brutal extraction. I think every pore in my face were filled with cysts and comedones, I was so hopelessly lost.

Three years later, my skin is almost clear— I still get spots on my chin sometimes, though. I used to scoff at people who say “it gets better” but I can’t believe it actually happened to me.

Believe it or not, accutane/isotretinoin wasn’t involved because my liver is too weak to handle it. Instead, I was given combination birth control for my PCOS by my OB. My derm didn’t prescribe antibiotics, but gave me oral supplements like glutathione, 1000 mg vitamin C, and 150mg zinc.

Here’s my skincare routine for anyone interested:

However, I changed my sunscreen to Elta MD UV clear around 2 weeks ago. My skin has been loving it and it feels more “elegant” (idk the exact term) than the LRP one.

EDIT: Microneedling and CO2 laser were done after my pimples were gone. These took care of the scars. I think they worked really well, because right after my pimples healed, they were done immediately to me— giving no chance for scars to form.

EDIT 2: For some reason, my edits also keep becoming replies so I have to delete them. Idk why.",1691

Routine/products in comments.",8182,https://i.redd.it/c6p0wekvy2ea1.jpg,"The top photos are from 2014-2016. The bottom photos are from the past year.

I quit drinking in 2015 and began my diet/lifestyle change in 2016.

My skin always had a redness/ruddiness to it. I would get acne breakouts a few times a year but generally only had a pimple here and there. I went through a 5 or 6 year period with awful, painful dry patches under my eyes in the winter. I also had constant, terrible dark circles. All of those concerns have dramatically improved, and my skin hasn't had any major issues in years. It currently stays relatively clear, and I haven't experienced the redness in several years.

I think the biggest factors that improved my skin were weight loss/diet change, quitting alcohol, improving my sleep, and adequate hydration. I currently eat 7-8 servings of fruit and vegetables a day and drink at least 100 ounces of water. I do believe I was chronically dehydrated and also had a severe vitamin D deficiency.

My routine:

AM: wash face with glycerine bar soap

Sunscreen: Supergoop Unseen

Moisturizer: the Ordinary Rose Hip Seed oil mixed with sea buckthorn berry oil (I love moisturizing with oils and feel they keep my skin mouisurized better than creams)

Undereye: Heimish marine care eye cream (I really like the feel of this cream. It goes on very smoothly and feels lightweight).

PM: .025% tretinoin (I believe my usage of tretinoin has kept fine lines from forming on my forehead)

Supplements: vitamin D and omega-3",559

I’d love to get your a situation that I have, if you’re willing. Zero pressure as this is about you and your win 😊

I just don’t enjoy a lot of food. I cook a lot of different food and they’re mostly healthy (lots of chicken types and salad) but I often let it sit and throw it away. It’s pretty disappointing to have so much all around waste and resort to eating, let’s say, a bag of chips or pita chips / hummus. 

For context, I grew up as an extremely picky eater. I do not eat seafood and whenever my Mom would make a fish dinner, I’d refuse as a little kid. Ultimately, my parents set a timer of one hour and I’d sit there, waiting for the minutes to be done with. 

I knew that I wasn’t getting dessert and would instead feed all of it to my dogs & cats (turns out, they loved tuna) and throw the rest in the toilet. My parents are very kind and did their best to encourage that I had proper nutrition. But I’ve always wondered about that stage in life where you have to “eat your vegetables” or even “eat fish” when that smell and taste is horrifying to me. 

I guess my question is: my parents tried their best. I still resort to what tastes good. I honestly wish that I had a more open palate as most of my loved ones are foodies. But I can’t change what I like. Or can I?

This was so long. Thank you for any & all replies 😊",6

My skin type is a combination of dry and oily. Mainly dry around my mouth area and oily on my nose. I also started drinking a LOT more water since you need to stay very hydrated while on accutane. I also tried my best to stay out of the sun whenever i could and definitely tried my best to NEVER pick at or even touch my face. I used to do that a lot but I have completely stopped entirely! My top 3 products are of course the ones i use. The cetaphil gentle cleanser is perfect for me and it is really nice on the skin, i used the daily skin cleanser and it actually burned my skin. The moisturizing cream is amazing and keeps my skin feeling smooth and not tight from the dryness i would occasionally get. The tinted sunscreen is the best, idk where i would be without it tbh. It feels good on the skin and it really blends in, depending on your skin tone ofc. It helped hide the redness that I had a bit so it made it look less apparent. I would also recommend a final product which is, burts bee hand cream. I would randomly sometimes get a rash on the back of my hand that would get crusty and bumpy and this cream was the only thing that helped. Everytime i go the rash, i would put the cream on and it would make the rash go away in about 2-3 days.",95

-please take good good care of your immune system. 
    -it was dried out on this med
-replenish all needed vitamins and minerals responsibly. If you are able to get a full blood panel done, do it. Check your liver and kidney functions, not to mention cholesterol. 
-look into products like BioOil to help with the fresh scarring. This stuff is amazing with scars (and wrinkles, stretch marks, etc.) and is not that expensive. You may be worried bc it is in fact an oil, but it is light and very healing.

I’m sorry you had to suffer that injury but what exemplary healing!

As for the redness sometimes appearing darker, I’ve had the same thing happen with fresh scars. And this IS fresh - it’s not even a month old injury! Best advice is to protect it from the sun and give it time. You can try covering it with makeup if you’re comfortable with that. 

If it’s really causing you problems, you can discuss prescription lightening agents with your doctor. I scar easily but don’t typically deal with hyperpigmentation. Nonetheless I got a dark facial scar after a botched TCA CROSS procedure, and I was prescribed a combo therapy of topical tretinoin and hydroquinone to lighten it... the latter does carry risks and may not be covered by insurance; in my case I was apprehensive so I just used the tretinoin and was religious about sun protection (not only sunscreen but wide-brimmed hats and avoiding prolonged sun exposure, too) and now I can’t even remember the exact spot where the discoloration was as I can’t see it at all anymore.",1

I don't think I could take the achey joints and dryness another go round

I've had to wash my face every day (morning and evening, just face wash and toner and now moisturizer) or else my face would break out. Even so, I still gain pimples and deal with acne. I once begged my mom to take me to the dermatologist because it was getting so bad. Now I'm trying to get better skin using the resources on this sub.

On the other hand, my current roommate only washes his face using water once a day before going to bed. He doesn't break out, but he has huge pores and his face looks kind of rough. Kind of envious of the lack of effort he has to put in; if he put in any at all, he'd surely have flawless skin. And I have another friend, who's a girl, and she simply washes her face every morning and evening and her face is flawless.

I've heard men actually get worse acne and skin due to the oiliness caused by testosterone, which is why for trans women, going on estrogen helps their skin and makes it clearer and softer, and for trans men, going on testosterone makes their skin more oily and they break out. I think it must be that we just don't hold guys to as high a beauty standard in terms of skincare.",7

This is not an insult to the person who created / starred in / posted the video...just saying the contouring and Vaseline on lashes have been ""things"" for decades with those of us at the beach using Vaseline for conditioning lashes and keeping some mascara on while at the beach / pool...and the drag community gave us many wonderful makeup ""tricks"" like using deeper contour on the sides of the nose (and highlighter on top) or vise versa for creating the illusion of different shapes; so to me those are cool to see but nothing new. Overdrawn lips have been taught to us since the 90's and even then I was told prior celebs like Bridgette Bardot used that tip in the 1960's. I can appreciate the blush and concealer as a ""hack"" for those who have serious dark circles because it is not her way of colour correcting and is the one thing that actually shows an item you already own giving a similar effect as buying a new product(s).
 Lastly could someone please explain what the water foundation thing is for or why I would potentially try it? It kind of feels like it would be a gloomy mess but I may be completely wrong and am willing to listen and love to learn. Cheers All! Becky Elizabeth",8

-this shade was described as ""deep and alluring wood brown"". Imo, the shade is less brown and has a hint of berry irl compared to the photo from the site. Formula is creamy but slightly drier compared to Romand's zero velvet tint, but that makes it less transferable and more long-lasting. I would suggest exfoliating your lips before application as it can settle on flaky spots.

One thing I don't like about this is the stain. It stains with a bright pink color which is soooo different from the initial brown shade. Does anyone know if most shades from the blur fudge tint line stain the same way? I really like the smooth and long-lasting formula, but the stain color is just inconsistent.

**Peripera Ink Mood Glowy Tint in 03 Rose In Mind**

-described as ""a figgy rose color for autumn mute skin tone"". It's a bit cooler than I expected upon application, but it deepens to a very flattering rosy shade. It brightens up my face and the stain is consistent with the initial color. Formula is quite moisturizing and looks more watery than glossy. I already have 01 Best Beige Menu in my cart for my next purchase!

**Laka Fruity Glam Tint in 107 Sugar**

-It's my first Laka product and I'm loving it! Texture reminds me more of a lip oil and the formula applies the color evenly and doesn't settle on dry patches and lines. Upon application, this shade applied almost like a milky orange, but it definitely deepens quickly. [Here's a comparison of what it looks like initially and after 10 mins.](https://i.imgur.com/bl3foxZ.jpeg). Stain is consistent with the shade and not very strong which is expected anyway as the formula is on the thinner side. Personally, I find the shade a bit too orange on its own, but I think this would be a great base color to mix with.",106

It stains with a bright pink color which is soooo different from the initial brown shade. Does anyone know if most shades from the blur fudge tint line stain the same way? I really like the smooth and long-lasting formula, but the stain color is just inconsistent.

I’m not positive, but sometimes I suspect that this bright pink stain some products leave behind has to do with the ingredient Red 27 or 28 Lake (CI 45410). This is the common ingredient you find in those “mood lipsticks” that are supposed to react to your lip pH to give you a “custom” lip stain. A lot of these so-called “mood” lippies would turn a garish, sometimes neon pink on me (Lipstick Queen’s Frog Prince being a rare exception of giving me a nice MLBB, very much like the stain in your photo). Maybe depends on the formulation, but this ingredient’s results are inconsistent on me. For instance, Red 28 Lake (CI 45410) is found in both Amuse Dew Tints, and 3CE Syrup Layering Tints. I don’t have any problems with Amuse, but boy oh boy, slap 3CE Syrup Layering Tints on me and you see a neon undertone. I don’t experience the bright pink problem with products that don’t contain this. Red 27 or 28 Lake (CI 45410) do seem to help with providing a strong, lasting stain though. I just checked the major ingredients for the Blur Fudge Tints on yesstyle and this line does indeed contain Red 28 Lake (CI 45410).

(Romand, Peripera, Laka)",1681,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/x85h8v,"It's because being Korean brands, their swatches are on Korean models who fall in between a specific range of light tones with paler pink lips. I'm Korean and I find most of their advertised swatches true to color.

So unfortunately, someone with different skintone, lip shade and features (ranging anywhere from Scandinavian to deeper toned) will find that the shades look completely different on them.

Korean brands will also now state what personal color a lip color is best suited for: for example - soft summer, deep autumn, light spring, etc. So the advertised swatches show what the shades will *ideally* look like if you fall under the same season/color. So many will neglect tones and just get a lip color seeing that the advertised swatch is a nice, muted coral (meant for light spring tones) but in reality, the shade will look off on them because the buyer is *not* light spring.

So it's important to find out one's true tone and color! Not all warm toned folks are the same nor are all cool toned folks. And truth be told, lip colors will always look wildly different from person to person and what looks good on Koreans won't always be for others. For instance, cult favorite MAC's Velvet Teddy looks gorgeous on many, but for most Koreans it makes us look washed out and gray.",42

Some brands, especially brands like rom&nd, make all the product pictures for the collection more cohesive-looking by playing with filtering and changing around the lighting and colours in the pictures. It ends up that, in combination with the model’s different skin tone, the colour may look wildly different in the photo to how it will look on you. That’s why I always search for reviews and shade swatches on the product before buying them. It particularly helps if you can find multiple reviewers (like YouTubers) who have a similar tone (personal colour) to you or you know gravitate towards similar colours. If it’s a product I know is popular, there is also a chance it will be sold in one of my local imported beauty stores, so I go there to swatch the colour and see the texture before buying.",8

JLT tends to be more opaque and less viscous. I actually like how the peripera tint is not as pigmented since I can be more generous with the application to keep my lips moisturized. I can even apply it without a mirror since the pigment isn't that strong.

With Romand's JLT, I have to be careful to not apply too much if there's a certain level of intensity that I want. It's advertised as moist but because I don't do a full application for daily use, my lips can get quite dry. I think it's only their Bare Juicy series that I apply with a full layer (the one with Pomelo Skin and Bare Grape) since the shades are on the nude side.

Scent wise, I like the scent of Peripera more (it smells like vanilla with mild floral notes). I've noticed Romand's JLT line has this chemical smell that can get strong at times (I think I don't notice all the time since I rarely do a full thick layer). Their glasting tints have a pleasant fruity smell though, so I think it's just the Juicy Lasting Tints.",9

(I went back and found the Twitter thread [here](https://twitter.com/gni_dream/status/1357157947156008961), from February 2021.) He said the neon pink thing is caused by “Red 218” (in Japan and Korea) aka Red 27 or CI 45410, which is used in oil-based lip tints. And as you know, Red 28 and Red 28 Lake (“Red 104 (1)” in Japan and Korea) are also CI 45410, and are used in water-based lip tints [ETA that he didn’t say this one turns neon pink, but he also didn’t say that it doesn’t]. I wonder whether this means “Red 231” (also same CI and also Red 28 I think? “Red 104 (2)” in Korea) could turn neon pink, too, although it wasn’t included in the colorants [he listed](https://twitter.com/gni_dream/status/1330125804202758145) that are used in lip tints (in Japan, at least). He also noted that “Red 223” (Red 21 or CI 45380) turns neon pink as well, though I guess maybe not as prominently as “Red 218.”",9

1. If you don't want your lip tint to turn fluorescent pink, just remember this.It is because of red 218 that it is dyed fluorescent pink. If you don't like fluorescent pink, choose a product that contains red 227. Ingredient names are written on the package.I will say it again. Choose Red 227 instead of Red 218!

>2. Most stick tints are red 218 fluorescent pink.  
>  
>3. Many bottled products contain Red 227.Red 227 can basically only be added to water-based formulations. Many stick products are non-aqueous formulations, so there are almost no products containing Red 227.  
>  
>5. I have already explained about lip tint in a little more detail, so please take a look here as well.[https://twitter.com/gni\_dream/status/1330125804202758145](https://twitter.com/gni_dream/status/1330125804202758145)  
>  
>7. I didn't write it because it would be difficult to understand, but red 218 is not the only fluorescent pink, but red 223 is sometimes used.In any case, if you choose a product that contains red 227, there is no doubt that it is a lip tint that does not turn fluorescent pink.  
>  
>8. I explained in more detail the secret of dyeing lip tint and how to use it well for those who have chapped lips.In addition to talking about red 218 and red 227, we also explain other organic pigments and how to protect your lips from the irritation of tint.Please listen to it if you don't mind.[https://voicy.jp/channel/1539/126685](https://voicy.jp/channel/1539/126685)",6

I'd check out this [introduction to personal color analysis](https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/2hjrhz/an_introduction_to_personal_color_analysis_aka/) to help you get started. Many redditors have uploaded helpful guides! For me, I started a process of elimination. 1: Which colors do I absolutely avoid and I know are unflattering on me? (I look horrible in medium to deep reds, purples and browns) 2. What season do those colors fall under? (I can eliminate winter and autumn just based off of those colors that I avoid).

\- In the ads, they will state the personal color next to the lip swatch. If you visit yesstyle and check out some of the ads, you'll see it in their gallery. If not written in English, it's written in Korean.

\- I'd say it's risky for certain people such as those who are: Deeper skintoned. Those who like greige/brown/cool beige lip shades as such shades are nearly nonexistent in Korean makeup. Those who don't like light or bright toned shades. Those who don't like corals, pinks, bright berry, orange shades, pastel shades, etc.

\- BUT, some Korean brands have been tapping into the western market and have been releasing more ""western-friendly"" shades such as Peripera and Dear Dahlia. Peripera has been releasing deeper lip shades great for deeper tones. I reckon, slowly but surely, more Korean brands will release such shades.",18

My face was just a result of me not cleaning my skin properly, and then wearing shitloads of makeup to cover it up (which I either slept with, or never removed with proper makeup remover 🤦🏻‍♀️)

The sunscreens I normally use are

• Suncut Perfect UV Gel
• BOJ sunscreen 
• CosRX Aloe Sun Cream
• Anessa Perfect UV Gel
• Skin Aqua Super Moisture Gel Gold

I’ll rotate between any of these, depending on what i feel like using, but I prefer the Skin Aqua one when im reapplying, because it melts into nothing, and gives such a nice glowy finish. The alcohol in it makes my eyes water, but that goes away pretty quickly!

I also have the LRP Anthelios and the Anessa Perfect UV Milk, which I know a lot of people like because they feel like nothing on the skin, but I find those too drying for me. And I’m pretty sure the LRP broke me out 😩",2

1685,1685.0,1685.0,1685.0,1685.0,1685.0,,,,asianbeauty,[First Impression Review] Cezanne Lasting Curl Mascara: a mascara that REAAALLY holds a curl!!!,1176,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/129lokc,"Hi! I thought I’d do a first impressions on this lovely Cezanne Lasting Curl Mascara in shade brown I just picked up. This is a long review for just a mascara but OMG.

I’ve always had issues with my lashes dropping and not holding a curl (especially on my right eye!). I tried a lot of tricks and curl mascaras, but I have long lashes so mascaras always looked pretty good, and I just accepted that even with my heated lash curler the curl was going to drop instantly. I actually picked up this mascara mostly because I liked the relatively light shade of brown rather than the curl aspect!

**So when I tell you I was SHOOK when I applied it and my curl didn’t disappear!!!!** I couldn’t BELIEVE it! My lashes felt like they’d been freeze-dried into a curl hahaha. They stayed put all day! ALL DAY! As you can see in the photo, they are CURLED AS HELL. Almost touching my eyebrows!!! I used a normal curler and then a heated curler, but honestly I think I don’t need my heated one anymore. I highly highly recommend this for people whose lashes won’t hold a curl no matter what. I honestly didn’t think such a product existed haha.

(The photo was taken just after application but it stayed on all day both times I’ve used it, 8+ hours. I wanted to take another photo when I got home but I ended up crying this day HAHA but the lashes still looked awesome!!!!! Taken on the front and the back camera so the images are flipped. Also FULL DISCLOSURE: I edited/smoothed my skin just to hide blemishes in these photos, but I edited nothing else!)

It is a little bit stubborn to remove, but easier than the Heroine Make one (which is quite good for curl but nothing on this Cezanne!). Cezanne recommends using their mascara remover, but I was okay removing mine with my make up remover (Chifure Washable Cold Cream) and my little microfiber makeup pad. (Edit: after using this for a while now, I now recommend using a mascara remover like the one from Heroine Make!)

It says this mascara can be used in 3 ways: as a mascara base (you can do one layer for the curl and then use a different mascara), as a normal mascara and also as a top coat. Double comb brush makes application easy, they’re slightly different shapes so you can use either side to catch all the lashes!

I have the brown which is really nice and soft, but it comes in clear, black and a new colour, mauve. The clear might be useful for using with other mascaras!

Packaging says it is “multiproof”, apparently meaning it is waterproof, sweat-proof, tears-proof and sebum-proof (not sure on the rules surrounding claiming things are -proof, as it’s in Japanese, but this is written on the packaging and the website so I believe it.) ~~This leads me to believe this is a tubing mascara, but I could be wrong as it isn’t said explicitly and I’m not an expert!~~ **I was wrong, it can’t be removed with warm water so it is not a tubing mascara!** It does make your lashes quite hard/crunchy so if you don’t like that, this might not be for you. But I couldn’t feel any discomfort at all through the day :) I wear contacts and they were fine for me.

Overall, I’m in love with this mascara. I honestly can’t believe it exists. I love Cezanne in general for their quality and prices, but this mascara is simply wonderful and it is only ¥638 ($4.81)!! I’ve only used it twice, but it’s a straight 10/10 for me! Thank you for reading!🤍

**Edit 1**: I think it was released in October 2022 so still kinda of relatively new, I’m not sure about online retailers I’m sorry! I bought it in person in Japan 🌸 but I can see it on YesStyle at least!

**Edit 2**: Eyeshadow deets!

I used the Rom&nd Better Than Palette in Pampas Garden 01, using coral shimmer shade Shining Pampas [marked in this picture](https://imgur.com/a/n373iiC) 03 (oh now I’m thinking about it, also maybe a touch of 04 to deepen the shade!)

Then I top with the glitter from the Canmake Juicy Pure Eyes trio in shade 11! I also use the Canmake glitter for my inner corner, it’s the BEST!

**Edit 3**: okay! This is a photo of my lashes curled with normal mascara (top), my lashes with nothing (middle) and this Cezanne mascara (bottom). I don’t have a photo of my bare lashes curled though, sorry😭

I totally get their ideas since I know marketing budgets for beauty products can go crazy.  So I stayed away from branded ones and focused on what I needed to fix my skin. 

**Morning and night**

[Rohto Hadalabo Gokujun Alpha Lotion (5.7fl Oz/170ml) ](https://a.co/d/2ZA0IlA)

I use it after shower or light face wash without cleanser. I like how thick they are comoare to typical toner or lotion. They are very hydrating on my skin. 

[Cos de baha az with azelaic acid ](https://a.co/d/9RDDnbP)

This worked great on my skin. I have had rosacea since I was little and never went away. With this product, they are definitely fading but still there. I am seeing the results and I highly recommend this if you are experiencing rosacea and melasma.

[merano CC medicinal stain Concentrate Care Serum 20ml](https://a.co/d/1YnBDrf)

I use it on my melasma spots under my eyes and cheeks after applying AZ. 

**Morning only**

After all those steps and somewhat dried, I apply Nivea sun 50 SPF before going out. Since I don't have any preferences for sun screen, I think this'll do for me. 


**Night only**

[SANA Nameraka Isoflavone Wrinkle Eye Cream N 20g ](https://a.co/d/2vY0xEY)

Since it's got retinol, I only use it around my eyes at nights. It did reduce small wrinkles, I was amazed how well it worked for me. I really like the texture. 

[Whitele Fifth all in one gel ](https://s.cosme.net/product/product_id/10206314/top)

I use it everywhere after shower. Sometimes on my face but I use more on my body especially arms and legs. I have random scars everywhere and I'm just trying to be nice to them. Honestly not sure if it's doing anything on my face. I still have a lot still since it's a huge bottle, I'm not repeating this, it was the only thing I was using before I started the real skincare. I will just purchase cetaphil next time.",67

How do you manage your facial hair? I feel like I have to use extra product or really try to rub it in because if I just leave it on the surface it gets absorbed by my hair rather than my skin. Also, what's your post-shave routine like? I use witch hazel (with alcohol for the little cuts) and go straight to moisturizer afterwards. 

I've just started to wash my face in the mornings, and it's made a really big difference, especially with regards to how my skin feels with moisturizer. However I have a hard time finding a non-oily sunscreen that won't sting my eyes that's approved for use here in Australia.",16

Regarding the Kikumasamune lotion, it has arbutin whose % is undisclosed.. some articles say arbutin shouldn't be used for longer than 3 months, as it may release hydroquinone in small amounts, which is banned in some countries due to fear of it being carcinogenic

I think the arbutin used in Kiku is vera arbutin and one study said, upto 7% conc of this is fine in creams, provided hydroquinone contamination is less than 1ppm.

You already have good products for what you’re focusing on though! Cos de Baha’s Azelaic is the strongest OTC one in the AB realm I believe, so if you hit a plateau and not satisfied, you may want to consider going to a derm to get one that’s prescription-strength.

I received a double sided brush (which is great), a face mask, and a lipstick sample set with my order.

To get the most obvious out of the way, the packaging is absolutely stunning. A beautiful honor to the famous poem ""Ode to the Goddess to Luo River"", the engravings on the shadows stay true to the palette's namesake by depicting the scene envisioned by Cao Zhi. Thankfully, this cardboard style case is also sturdy enough to withstand the multiple times I've dropped it.

The eyeshadows themselves are very buildable and creamy - I particularly love the two blush shades (or at least I'm using them as blush). The muted peach/terracotta tones are very suitable for everyday wear. I prime my eyes with the Urban Decay shadow primer and it generally lasts all day. However, the true test is that I cried very intensely while wearing these shadows and they still stayed on!

The pink shade is quite translucent and has fine gold glitter so it ends up looking similar to the pure gold shade right next to it, at least on my skin. Also the blue shade has small silver glitter a bit reminiscent to the Urban Decay's Moondust shadows. All the matte shades are very pigmented for Chinese eyeshadows. I have not liked the shimmer shades that much, but I've been experimenting with the blue and it's become my recent fav despite the slight stain it leaves behind.

If you're buying this for the aesthetic, brace yourself when you take that first dip because the eyeshadow engravings fade quickly with use. And unfortunately as with many East Asian brands, I don't know if this palette will be a good buy for those with deeper skintones. I really hope to see Florasis diversify their website and social media. I think this is an item that you really only buy for the packaging so having good quality shadows is a plus. I bought this in Taiwan for about $35 USD but on their U.S site the price is marked up to $59 USD + shipping. Whether or not it's worth the price is up to you; while I'm very happy with my purchase it's easy to find this color story and similar quality at more affordable/accessible places.

I hope this can provide some good insight! If you also have something from Florasis, or have any questions please let me know!",143

maybe it's pre-existing bias as someone who already is familiar with the innisfree brand, but as a gen z (and junior designer), i do not vibe with the redesign at all 😭 the original design felt more timeless with a sense of reliability (enhanced with the original italicized serif font of the logo), which made sense because they also made products marketed towards more mature consumers. but they just had to nuke that and make it virtually indistinguishable from every other ""trendy"" useless new brand out there. 

there is also no reason to show the brand name twice on the same side of the packaging. i understand this is for visual balance but this is too distracting from the actual product information too as my attention is directed to either of the bold font logos first before the ultra thin product name. then they reuse the same cookie cutter template on a \*solid beige background\*, which makes it harder to easily identify a single product even with the different colored text. they could have at least changed the background color depending on the specific product range, ie. green for green tea seed, brown for black tea, etc.

hell, if we take the [original design for the retinol cica ampoule](https://cdn.stylevana.com/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/1000x1231/17f82f742ffe127f42dca9de82fb58b1/i/n/innisfree-retinol-cica-repair-ampoule-50ml-569.jpg) which was already starting to move into a more modern and less traditional innisfree design, it at least looks cleaner with a strong vertical hierarchy with the focal point on the serum name, but the logo is still clearly distinguishable. now compare that with the [new design](https://www.roseroseshop.com/image/cache//data/brand/innisfree/light/innisfree_2304005_light-800x960.jpg). ugh. to be fair i think some of the older designs are a bit dated but i think they could've refined the visual direction they were taking with the retinol ampoule and find a good middle ground between fresh and classic. i love bold, sans serif fonts and minimalist designs, but good god, not like this.",4

I have so much I want to say about Korean gel polishes, I'm going to talk about the product first so it doesn't get buried!

**About the Polishes**

Nail set shown:
- Jin.B Pianissimo UV Gel Polish Collection 

Color on my nails:
- JB-107

Swatch Order:
- 110, 106, 107, 103, 105, 108, 109, 104, 101, 102 

Before I say anything else, it's important to note that these are gel nail polishes NOT regular nail polishes. You need a UV/LED nail lamp to cure the gel, and you will need to do some research beforehand on how to properly apply the polish and cure it. I recommend watching Paola Ponce on youtube. She's a really good introduction to gel nails and she actually specializes in Japanese soft gels! 

Onto the product: these polishes are called ""syrup polishes"" in Korean. Syrup polishes are thinner and less pigmented than normal, so they have a very translucent and jelly-like look (like syrup). If you have seen any of the popular Korean jelly nail looks on social media, they were most likely done using a syrup polish. 

The polish applies well and is self leveling so it doesn't get streaks or bumps. It's a bit thin so it will pool in your cuticles if you're not careful. It takes some practice to get used to. The colors are stunning though, it's a super versatile set of nudes and pinks that I will definitely wear very often. 

**What About UV Damage on Your Hands?**

I'm sure at least one person will ask this because everyone is so obsessed with suncare, myself included. I looked into it and there are special UV gloves without fingertips that you can buy for getting your nails done. I just made my own by buying black gloves and cutting the fingertips off. Of course, you can also put sunscreen on your hands beforehand too. 

**Buying the Polishes**

I was deciding between two stores to purchase these: Zillabeau and Danji Nails. I ended up going with Danji nails because it was cheaper at $85 (this is the actual price of the collection if you buy it in Korea). However, shipping was $40 😭. I know you might think I'm crazy to pay that, but even with shipping this was the cheapest place I could find. The shipping ended up being extremely quick (I would expect so for $40), and it took 5 days to get to America. 

The price of this set including shipping was pretty steep, but if you do the math it works out to $12 per bottle which isn't terrible. Gel polishes from American brands like CND, OPI, and Gelish are also around $10-$20 online. I guess a part of me wants to justify this big of a purchase lol. 

**My Deep Dive into Asian Nail Products**

So, I somehow fell down the very deep rabbithole of Korean and Japanese products this winter holiday. After religiously watching korean nail shop vlogs, I noticed that the brand Jin.B was really popular among technicians. I began looking into the brand and found this collection. I instantly fell in love with the color scheme and knew it would be a great introduction to Asian nail products. 

From what I've read on the internet, Asian gel polishes are gentler and better for your nails than western polishes. One of the reasons why is because they have lower levels of HEMA, which is a very common allergy trigger. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to verify the HEMA levels in Jin.B polishes, so I don't know if this is true for this particular brand. 

Regardless, I really want to try more Asian nail polish brands. Some other ones I'm curious about are Jello Jello, F Gel, Tiny Nails, and Leafgel. Unfortunately, there is not really a lot of information about Asian nail products online, and I haven't been able to find an active community to talk about it. 

The Asian nail market hasn't really expanded much past Asia, unlike the skincare market. This means that there are little to no vendors for a lot of products and many are marked up ridiculously high. I really hope that Asian nail products become more popular so there can be a larger international market and community. I would honestly be ecstatic if there was an Asian nail care subreddit!!

If any of you guys like Asian nail products or know of any good vendors, please leave a comment because I would love to discuss it further!",133

After healing my skin barrier, I definitely struggled next with sebaceous filaments on my nose and chin. What helped me most was using the Skinfood black sugar mask and egg white pore mask (i know people have mixed opinions about physical exfoliators so use them very gently) and using a thin layer of Neutrogena Rapid Clear Stubborn Acne Spot Gel (it might be too strong for some folks since it's 10% benzoyl peroxide so please be careful), letting it dry, and washing it off helped! I also use sheet masks and my I'm From Honey or I'm From Mugwort masks often to make sure i dont damage my skin barrier!

Also, I wash my pillowcases pretty often! :D

I used to buy from yesstyle but now I buy from Stylevana/Stylekorean and also picked up some stuff when I was in Korea this summer!

I knew I was a deep autumn by reading guides like [this](https://theconceptwardrobe.com/colour-analysis-comprehensive-guides/color-analysis-which-color-season-are-you) and just putting color swatches next to my skin and asking other people to objectively tell me if it washes me out! For instance, I look better in jewel tones (emerald green, burgundy/wine, dark blue, etc.) and look sooo washed out in pastels! Also, I realized by figuring out what makeup colors clash for me! For instance, my skin looks good in mauves/muted rosy tones and has an olive skin tone but clashes with cool pinks or pastels! I'm still figuring it out, though- a work in progress haha!

Don't get too bogged down by the color seasons tho! Overall, just wear what you like and what makes you confident <3

**kose softymo oil cleanser:** i've been using this oil cleanser for years and love how fast it removes makeup. it was the first oil cleanser i tried though, and i haven't branched out since. it does take a bit longer (like an extra min) to remove waterproof mascara but i don't mind. will repurchase.

**hada labo gokujun foaming cleanser:** this is my first time trying the new formulation. this one has been leaving my skin feeling dry and tight after, unlike the original one. i had to stop double cleansing with it in the morning. i won't repurchase this one unless i can't find a replacement by the time i run out.

**skinfood rice mask wash off:** i really like how soft and bright my skin looks and feels after using this. it does sting a bit while it's on my skin though, but it's not too uncomfortable. the soft and bright skin is worth it!

**hada labo gokujun premium lotion:** i like how fast this toner(?) sinks into my skin, but that's pretty much it lol. won't be repurchasing this since there's a lot of toners i've been wanting to try

**cosrx advanced snail mucin essence:** another product i've been using on and off for years. i recently started tretinoin and noticed my skin becoming dry in some areas + peeling so i decided to use this again in hopes of getting rid of that and it worked overnight lol. will keep repurchasing.

**etude soon jung emulsion:** can't really say much about this, but i like how lightweight it feels on my skin.

**etude soon jung barrier cream:** i really like this moisturizer! it was actually the first moisturizer i tried that didn't make my face feel greasy/heavy. i've been wanting to try the illiyoon and aestura moisturizers though, so not sure if i will repurchase it when i finish it.

**isntree hyluronic acid watery sun gel:** doesn't leave a whitecast, leaves a nice glow on my skin, and doesn't irritate it like other sunscreens have (biore uv). i don't think i'll repurchase it soon since i have the boj sunscreen that i've been wanting to try coming in the mail.. but if it doesn't work out with that one, i'll be going back to this!",81

Nooo... don't go back to it. Definitely try something else. I want to recommend something but I'm still using Hada Labo Hydrating foam's old formula and my other cleansers aren't very accessible for most people. 

Maybe try looking into roundlab dokdo cleanser, skin1004 ampoule foam, etude house soon jung 5.5 foam cleanser and Purito from green deep foaming cleanser?

Haha i do the same thing with this. Very on and off. Only use it when my skin gets too dehydrated. Sometimes i let my friends and family have a try when my skin don't need it. Then would repurchase when i run out 😆

Thought I'd share my thoughts as someone with dark skin. Most of the products mentioned in the OP are hydrating, and skin tone has no impact on how hydrating you may find a product to be. 

If you have concerns about hyperpigmentation, then you should be aware that most brightening products (the OP's rice mask) still work for people with darker skin. However, it may take longer to get results, especially if the dark spots are older. Consistency is key. Also, for fading hyperpigmentation, sunscreen is a must.",30

Some people suck. You didn't do anything at all wrong or to deserve it. And honestly, you handled it better than I would have and I'm more than twice your age. I could definitely see myself crying because of her shitty attitude. 

It's a big deal to treat people that way. You're not exaggerating. Sometimes people just suck and take it out on others.",82

She acted like that because she was she was a bitch. You had every right to come in and ask to see products. She's there to assist anyone who comes in to shop, whether they're buying or looking. Maybe she's bitchy because her commissions weren't high : ) 

In regards to age, I went to a Sephora for an entire collection of makeup - new job. Also had the person who was transitioning into a new job-look with me. We knew we wanted a particular brand - bare Minerals, but needed to be skin-type and color matched. Each set was approx. $250. After helping for a brief amount of time and applying makeup specifically to HALF of our faces (as if we were there to get a freebie make up application), she abruptly said ""ok ladies are you going to buy anything?"" It was bizarre. It was about 2 pm and there weren't other customers in Sephora (inside JC Penney's). Mind you, ladies in our 50's and dressed appropriately as we'd be for our job for this shopping trip. I said I was leaving to pick up a kid from school ... Bye!!! Purchased 2 sets at another Sephora. Easy for that sales person since we were ready to buy at the first location. So weird. Who knows what her deal was but there was no way I was going to be insulted and give her $500. 

point being - it was her, not you.",30

To see if they will actually say again the snide comment. Usually they won’t attempt it and if they do again say ‘ I’m sorry, what did you say’ like you didn’t hear it or can’t believe it.
Then, usually straight up asking, ‘are you saying that to be mean? ‘  will stop them in their tracks, with a follow up like ‘ are you a mean girl? Are you actually saying that to put me down’ ?
No one wants to be called a mean girl.
Most girls like this would not have the gumption to actually carry this behaviour out when they’re called on it.

I’m not sure which makeup store you went to, but I worked at Sephora when I was in college. We were required to do three weeks of training before we were even allowed on the floor, and an entire week was dedicated to customer service. And we had ongoing training, largely due to new trends in beauty and different ways we can help customers and meet their demands.

I explained this because if you went to Sephora, that behavior isn’t tolerated AT ALL and I urge you to report her to management. If you don’t remember her name, at least describe what she looked like. Trust me when I say that managers shared all customer complaints and gave us feedback to perform better.

And even beyond the corporate training standards, it’s about being a decent human being and making someone feel amazing about themselves. It’s amazing knowing you made someone’s day and helped someone out, even if it’s just showing them how to do a cat eye or fill in their brows.

Otherwise, do you need help finding a bright eyeshadow palette? I’m sure anyone here can give you a recommendation!",2

I work in cosmetics retail (not ulta or Sephora, but I did a brief employment at ulta and hated it). I love my job and I love my customers. I have regular customers that ask for me every time they come in. I did a leave of absence from this job recently (I’ve worked here almost 6 years) and my first day back I had several regulars immediately ask where I’ve been. 

I hope I’ve never made a customer feel bad. I try to provide as much knowledge, help, and personal opinion/experience as possible so they can make an informed purchase. I’ve spent over an hour with a single customer helping them look for exactly what they need. I helped a chemo patient find the perfect eyebrow routine and even did them for her while she told me about her life. I did my best to help non English-speaking customers pick out a skincare routine to fit their needs. I teach little girls and boys about the fun and creativity aspect of makeup. 

Try a smaller store if you went to a huge chain retailer. I will say that I work for Estée Lauder but not at a counter in any department store. EL has about a hundred or so outlet stores across the states and a couple in other countries. Everything I sell is discounted and comes from the same warehouse as products sent to ulta and the department stores. We also don’t make any commission and there’s no reason to lie in order to sell product. At my store at least, we tell you if we think a product is worth the money or not. I speak for myself and my coworkers when I say we want to help and we want to make you feel beautiful.",2

I've never bought anything from him, but I was recently gifted one of his palettes and it's pretty good quality so yeah, I use it, but I'd never give him any of my money and it has honestly blown my mind for YEARS that people do. I grew up listening to punk music and he always shared my aesthetic, but I always just thought he was a giant piece of trash in the way he likes to shock people with his remarks. I don't know of anything in recent years specifically because I don't really follow anyone in particular or keep up with that sort of thing, but I watched a video someone posted in one of these comments and I'm like, ""Yup, that's who I remember!"" 

I think that it's gotten better over the last 50 years as far as bigotry, misogyny and general intolerance goes, but we have way too far to go. It blows my mind that we have had generations since the civil rights movement (I'm American, so I can only speak for the USA) and yet there are still SOOO many hateful people allowed to spread their ignorance without much backlash. These people should be cancelled once they show that side of themselves to show that we won't tolerate it. I don't care how harsh that is. We CAN bring up this generation of children not to blindly hate people for their differences, but it won't happen if we allow ourselves to brush it off. It needs to be absolutely UNACCEPTABLE. Period! I'm white and was raised by ignorant, racist white parents and yet I've had no problem raising my kids to stand up to bullies in the name of others, not to judge anyone until they get to know them despite rumors or anything else, not to laugh at jokes at others' expense, pain is not funny, violence is worse to see in a movie than sex, that men sometimes love men, women sometimes love women and sometimes men and women love each other and any of those combinations are okay as long as they treat each other well, etc. It's not difficult at all and I don't want to get into politics, but people like Donald Trump and Joe Arpaio being in positions of power and being openly racist, sexist and homophobic are not sending the right message. You can't say ""Well, I don't agree with their bigotry, but I can look past it because I like the way they take care of business."" If you're going to vote someone into office, you should be voting for someone who sets a good example in all areas, our children and weak minded are watching. If I come across a makeup tutorial or anything else online where I am shocked by something derogatory that's said, I don't care how ""snitchy"" it is, I will report it. My kids are not allowed on social media yet anyway, but I just think, I would never want them to come across a video like that someday and think it's acceptable. I can't think of any one person in particular, but it doesn't really matter who it is, I don't think it's alright for anyone. I'm a pretty laid back person, but I cannot sit back and not say or do something when I encounter people hurting people in any way. 

Sorry for the novel. It might have been a bit overboard, but in this day and age when everyone's every thought is put out there for the world to see, we need to do right and I feel so strongly about that. My kids are 10 and 12 and I hear stories about the kids at their school being nasty to each other which can only be attributed to what they see and hear. My daughter's teacher called me a few weeks ago to thank me for teaching my daughter to be a strong leader who stands up for kids being harassed. I'm a mediocre mom at best so if I can teach my kids to be that way, it should be more common than it is.

I still don't know how James Charles is not behind bars and he started off with racist comments, then with transphobic and then was exposed to be attracted to minors and everyone is like a seal clapping that he's great and how dare we not defend him. 

I defended Jeffree a bit too long, I admit the fault on my part because I enjoyed his products and being a gay trans man I just couldn't relate to the fact that everything was very... Conservative in that only women should wear it and etc, or pandering to just women like Patrick Ta calling everything she's that and this or KVD calling their latest products in a Patrick Ta manner. He was like a problematic fave for a long while for me, but then I just got tired of excuses and with the decline of the beauty community on YouTube I just gave up all together and do my own makeup without trends. I'd rather not have some youtube guru to look up to than a trashpile. 

I also want to say that people really forget that a lot of the makeup trends stemmed from drag queens and etc, so feeling men left out of the makeup convo just made me feel uncomfortable. 

Manny always had a history of transphobia behind him, so I fell off liking him too fast. 

Patrick is probably the only one who I still watch along with Wayne Goss (who I feel is very transparent with his reviews?). 

All in all, this isn't an excuse in any way, just to shed some light that factually the biggest male beauty space gurus were shit and there's still a lot of homophobia and transphobia in it on top of racism that oozes from these gurus. 

And Jeffree's weird rant supporting Kanye was quickly forgotten which is absolutely whack considering its a few days old and makes me question what pigeon brain span do people have... The yak farm issue with the meat and drug addiction rumours, anyway... its a mess.

That doesn't mean that the beauty community isn't racist. It is. It's why white creators will show up in my suggested videos no matter how few white creators I'll be watching at the time. Dark skinned creators aren't watched by white people even though their reviews of products aren't about whether they show up on their skin.

You'd have to live under a rock and not be a part of the makeup community to never hear about his past.

Like bruh if you were on the internet anytime from 2005-2018 you’d know how bad he is and it’d be easier to make a list of things he hasn’t done 😭. 

I think the best thing moving forward would be to just educate people on his past and the severity of it all. Bc the other thing I noticed was that the new generation doesn’t know the extent of the shit he’s done and think he just made some one off comment in 2008. 

That being said if you aren’t part of the new generation/are very well versed in his past you have no excuse to be supporting him as a person. Like so what he’s been on a ranch for 5 years, if he didn’t change his awful ways from the 2000’s to 2018 he’s not changing them now",1

The beauty industry as a whole has progressed very much (especially over the last few years) to be extremely aware of inclusivity. 

Of course, you must understand that not everything is perfect and there is *always* room for improvement— especially in such a large, fast, and corporate industry. Don’t just go and throw all the wonderful things we’ve *had* happen under the rug and forget about them. 

You should acknowledge and celebrate even the smallest of advances in the right direction, and continuously work for more. It’s a long road to get *everyone* on board, and it’s not going to happen overnight. The beauty industry (as a whole) is all about the money; it takes more than a few tweets to change these big brands’ agenda. 

As far as the Jeffree Star thing, why do you care about the personal doings of others (that you don't even know)? Sure, he can be the *worst* person in the world— but so was Charles Manson, and he’s *still* got a shitton of followers. What’s the difference? Where’s the outrage in these instances? There are *plenty* more examples of this hypocrisy.

The BEST advice in life is to always just focus on *yourself*. If you don’t support him, that’s totally fine. But spending your days wondering why ‘there’s so much hype’, ‘so much support’, ‘so many excuses’ is going to drive you crazy and make you miserable.

Open letters or videos accusing him of being racist and not making room in the make up review blogger world for black influencers. 
None of it has been proven, or backed up by any actual evidence. 

So in this genre everyone is trying to basically get attention… that’s how they make their money. 
One of the fastest ways to do that is accuse someone already established of something controversial .. and with the accusations of him preventing black influencers to succeed in the market ( again not backed up by any evidence) to me.. just sounds like a attention ploy. 

It’s so hard to believe everyone just jumps on these trains as soon as they hear these trigger words.
It’s dangerous .. 
it’s how witches got burned. 

If people don’t have evidence to present - they need to stop accusing people of heinous shit. We should be cancelling the people who accused him of this stuff without evidence.

Jeffrey was famous and a millionaire before all this drama began, he has a stable fanbase and you know how these people are willing to support their artist. In second place, whatever you like it or not, the guy has made a place for himself in the make up industry so him giving his review is a guarantee that tha make up you want to buy works relatively well so it's not a waste of money. Lastly, his make up brand seems to be distancing from Jeffrey's persona so the brand, a professional use make up, is being considered an independent from Jeffrey's marketing. It's like Fenty beauty that you barely associate it to Rihanna because it becomes a professional and well established brand on the market. 

That you like his make up or his reviews doesn't make you racist. What make you racist is to actively discriminate other ethnicities.

As a consumer, I like to watch influencers of color- while their foundation reviews and tips and tricks may not help my fair skin, I think it is a wise choice to support honest creators who have a vested interest in uplifting marginalized communities- you also get more honest foundation reviews, and are able to see firsthand which companies cater to the sisters (and brothers) that were previously excluded- which allows you as a consumer to support these companies. Put your dollar (and your views ) to good use. Leave people like Jeffree without views and you begin to see the world around you shift. It’s unfortunate that at the end of the day, a business will only respond when money is coming out of their pockets and they don’t see the same kinds of revenue more inclusive lines are getting, but that also paves the way for them to shift gears and begin to do what they ought to have in the past.

If you don't think the makeup community isn't heavily racist, it's not going to be. It's all about perception. 

Also, we watch creators that are either entertaining or are similar to us. Especially for makeup, we're going to have to watch videos that not only entertain us but suit our needs. For instance, it doesn't make sense for me to watch white or black creators, because my skin color and facial structure is vastly different from them. Unless it's actual makeup art, then what I watch have to correlate with what I can do to my own skin. It doesn't mean I don't support other creators of different races, but I support other creators more than others. 

Example: It won't make sense to watch James Charles for me, because the foundation, eye shadow colors, and eyeliner shape doesn't match with what I am able to do. So, I don't watch him.

I find that browns pull very pink on me, and I have to adjust to compensate for that. I use an olive toned brown eyeshadow as my bronzer (MAC sumptuous olive), and a neutral bronzer like benefit hoola makes a great blush.

I only recently realized I'm fair olive as well after years of thinking I was just neutral and hating most foundations on me.

My actual skin beneath my rosacea has always been so pale and translucent that my veins show through though, and most of them appear as green tinted so it's honestly surprising that I never thought that maybe the green tint to my veins I always thought was weird might be my skin telling me that I have some olive in me 🙄 

I've also found over my years of experimenting with makeup that the best color matches I've ever found in base products have always been Korean or Japanese skin tints that look almost gray when you first apply them (three of my favorites being from the brands Dr jart,  Missha and Purito) despite me being neither Japanese or Korean. Finding a good match in western makeup brands is always a struggle because I feel like so many lean too pink in the fair category even when they call a shade neutral.

I have recently been on a HUNT for a new foundation. I have sampled around 10-15 and nothing works! It is very frustrating because, like you, all the reps say that I’m neutral but neutral shades look ashy and grey. Others look too peachy, yellow, or reddish. I also thought maybe the problem is my face is darker than my neck! I also have a hard time with bronzers - either they’re orange-y or yellow-y.

They say to look at your veins but none of mine match the descriptions. Mine are teal, turquoise, and a purple ish color.

If someone is trying to match and can't find the exact shade, they will definitely recommend the best one they have, and not everyone has an olive tone. Not everyone is the best matcher, and I have seen a lot of people struggle to match olive. 

Additionally, if someone asks for a certain foundation and it doesn't have a perfect match for them, if someone would recommend a different brand for a better shade,  they still sometimes go with the one they wanted to try, and that's fine.

I've noticed that quite a few foundations are not the undertone they are labeled as, which is another entirely frustrating can of worms.

I'm not sure if they just had not worked with olive skin enough to match or what. But as a professional that should be able to work with a variety of skin tones and undertones, it is their job to find the right foundation even if they have to create it from scratch. 

That said - I would have appreciated if they had told me - ""I am unfamiliar with your color so it's best we don't proceed"" or ""I'm not sure what your undertone is."" Proceeding with confidence where competence lacks a bit was disappointing.  They also took a photo and posted on social media.

A lot of these elaborate, colorful eye looks are meant to display the talent in application, not necessarily to flatter. It is awesome to showcase your skills that way. It is also awesome to wear products in ways that flatter you, even if it veers from popular trends.
 
It is okay to focus on interesting details (ex: a natural base with a pop of color on the waterline) as opposed to full-on lewksss. Neither makes you lesser or better. 
 
It is okay to go against popular advice. I do my eye makeup last because that’s what works best for me.

Years ago I was doing some side  work at night and on weekends doing construction for a person. They asked me about why I was working there so much and I said it was because my wife was having a child soon and I wanted the extra work to pay for the medical bills and thing we would need for our newborn. The last day of the job when I went to collect payment he asked me to come to the side as he had something for me. Him and his wife found my baby registry and easily bought us over $1k worth of things on our registry. They also gave us several cases of diapers in various sizes to carry us through several months. It was by far the kindest thing a stranger has ever done for me and I will never forget it their generosity. That was 10 years ago. It has inspired me to be a better person and my wife and I routinely donate to food shelters  whenever we are able and also do a bunch of work for a cancer charity. Enjoy the gifts you were given as that is why they were given. However since you are young please also use this as a great experience on how much you can change someone else’s life with a little bit of kindness and generosity to a stranger.

It can also be a nuisance to remove. Find something called “tubing mascara.” It completely coats each lash in a “tube” of sorts, & it’s waterproof. To remove it, gather water in cupped hands & hold against closed eyes for a few seconds. Do this a few more times then, using wet fingers, very gently & slowly pull from the base of the lashes. Because the mascara has formed a tube around your lashes, it’ll pull right off. If you have a clumpy area, wait til your lashes are dry, then wet your fingers & repeatedly hold your offending lashes between those fingers, then gently pull those wetted tubes right off & paint on a new coat. To help with any smudging beneath the eyes, do a cleanse of the eye area followed by 2 layers of primer followed by concealer/foundation/powder. I don’t seem to have that issue with Milani’s Highly Rated Lash Extensions tubing mascara. I also have deep set eyes that I have a habit of rubbing. Milani + double layer of primer under the eyes (I use e.l.f. Power Grip Primer).",2

Yes makeup doesn’t  last as long. However .. Clean beauty is usually marketed towards people who are more minimalist when it to comes to makeup. So they don’t own a lot of makeup.

Agree that some of the products are terrible and not worth the price, but some I would and have continued to repurchase:

- Magic Cream: if you are starting to hit your 40s, this is the best moisturiser I’ve found to use under makeup. She describes it as “plumping up your skin” and there is something about it that does “plump up” your skin surface, and leaves a slightly tacky surface that blends beautifully with foundation (can I recommend Lisa Eldridge’s here lol)

- Pillow Talk lip liner: it really mimics the tone & colour of your lipline, so again if you’re starting to age and losing some lip definition, colouring in those gaps around the outside makes a huge difference. HG.

- Hollywood Flawless Filter: CT generally does shimmer very well, and this is a great & versatile product that injects life into dull skin. There are probably dupes around but this one is good and I’m happy with it. 

- Walk of No Shame lipstick: I buy the version that’s more moisturising and comes in a slim tube. It’s the colour that’s great, very flattering on a wide range of skintones. Pillow Talk makes me look dead and I don’t understand the hype. 

- Magic Night Cream: this one would be controversial because many people dislike it, but I describe it as silky smooth vaseline. When my skin is super dry, smoothing a thin layer of it on after all other skincare (rub it between palms first) “locks” everything in. It’s the only thing I’ve found that combats dry cabin air on 14-hour flights, and it’s great for slugging. 

- the Airbrush whatever powder: I don’t use it because I have oily skin and it doesn’t have oil control, but if you have dry skin this might be the powder you’re looking for. Really great formulation and lots of my friends love it.",3

the blush literally disappears no matter how i blend it, if i use my fingers it just looks extremely patchy.

the contour wand is the patchiest thing everrrr i’m yet to find a replacement though because every one i find is either sold out or had bad reviews.

the highlight though is the best highlight i’ve ever used, for me it lasts a while because i only apply a little tiny bit, but i was shocked that i loved it so much because the blush and contour where so terrible",2

The one I've been using for over a year is Luna Magic Vava Pink lash primer, but I was restocking from Boxycharm's sales as a past subscriber. Well, recently they began charging a subscription fee to shop the sales and lol no. Especially since they were already charging $1.99 ""handling fee"" even if you spent enough to get free shipping. It's normally $25 I believe and it's good but not $25 good, it dries out really quick.

So, I've been looking for a replacement. The one from Clinique SUCKS btw, it doesn't do a damn thing for me at all. I wanted to try the Milani Lilac primer but it's now out of stock, not sure if it is discontinued. In any case, a good lash primer is a total game changer!",9

Edit: Also, who is voting. And sorted by goal. Like, one might be ""pretty makeup"" and you choose between two different images of faces with makeup. 
Another ""goal"" might be ""natural makeup-enhancing features."" That way people know what they're voting on specifically.

Edit 2: by who is voting, I mean it would be interesting to see what heterosexuals vs LGTBQ prefer. I.e. those who are attracted vs those who are not. The difference between aesthetics and attraction perhaps

A monetizing idea might be to find a way for the app to recognize the colors the AI makes and find preexisting products online with these shades. Then you can buy the shades it picked out for you.",2

For me personally, Sephora has been a godsend because I can get shade matches and knowledgeable advice, and then I know if something doesn’t work for me I can return it. Trying to look at drugstore makeup, I have to have a financial panic attack because I have no idea what’s going to work and then I’m most likely, speaking from experience, going to end up nickel and diming myself to the point where I could have just bought one expensive product that I was pretty confident was going to work. Honestly, I’ve wasted so much money over the years buying cheap stuff (clothes, makeup, household items) that didn’t work or fell apart and had to be replaced. I’m trying to invest in fewer items that are higher quality now. So I rarely buy makeup, and I don’t buy as much as I could if I bought cheaper stuff, but I make the stuff I buy really work for me. If you have the knowledge and skill to walk into a drugstore and confidently know what to get and how to make it work for you, why not?

It has a lot to do with the menstrual cycle. The week of ovulation will be your most attractive - skin is in better condition/glowy, the face appears more symmetrical.. even your lips will be a more appealing shape. Hair looks better too. It’s that spike in hormones that are designed to make you look extra attractive to a male since you’re most fertile. Then, a few days after ovulation, it’s a steady decline as the hormones drop. Makeup just seems to make it worse. 😂.. just have to ride it out until the good part of the month.

In that case, you'll need to get rid of the highlight in the corners of your eyes, put some navy blue and dark purple (like a plum color) under your eyes, and then go online and order some gray primer and foundation for your skin.  Then put Visine eye drops in your eyes and overdo it so that way you get the rebound redness and glassed look for your eyes.

Your boyfriend should go to an ophthalmologist and get checked for colorblindness.  Or just not be smoked himself while examining your make up lol.  Your make up is gorgeous and that lipstick is a beautiful color.  Your eyebrows are absolutely perfect too.",1

“After finding two different glosses that both consistently performed the floating phenomenon, we noticed they share a common ingredient: tin oxide.“ “Our theory of why the lip gloss floats? The tin oxide particles inside the gloss’s container rub against each other due to velocity gradients and viscous effects, which creates friction. As the lip gloss’s applicator moves inside and is then separated from its container, the present friction causes a potential difference between the lip gloss in the container and the gloss on the applicator. Between the applicator and the container, an electric field is created. This field causes a driving force for the lip gloss on the applicator to fly toward the container, along the electric field lines.”",57

What should I try (so far I've tried eyeliner and that's it),86,https://i.redd.it/hfpztodo07y91.jpg,"I came to talk about your eyes too! First of all, your eyebrows are magnificent. I wish I had eyebrows even remotely as beautiful. They are perfect, don’t change a thing. I think you would look really lovely with a couple coats of mascara (black or brown-black for more subtlety) and a sweep of coppery or soft warm brown eyeshadow across your crease. You could start with only the top lid, but the bottom would also look lovely if you wanted to try it.

If you want to do the bottom lid as well, I personally apply a thin line the same shade as my crease on the bottom lid to create a really subtle smokey eye look before applying mascara to the bottom lashes. This also helps cover any small accidental mascara smudges! Btw, if you ever do smudge your mascara, wait until it dries and you can sort of scratch it off - it becomes flakey when it dries on skin and it’s much easier to remove than if you try while it’s still wet.

I agree with the other commented on blush. A soft peachy blush would look gorgeous on your cheekbones. Highlighter would too, but for me it’s been harder and harder to find a good shade lately! Personally, I would go with the lightest shade you can find, but that’s just how I like to do it myself!

Finally, a glossy balm is a really easy way to create a more feminine look, and it’s beginner friendly - you can’t mess it up! I swear by the clear version of Maybelleine Baby Lips - it’s in a baby blue tube with pink lettering and you can pick it up at the drug store for $5-$6.

Best of luck! :)",7

What should I try (so far I've tried eyeliner and that's it),86,https://i.redd.it/hfpztodo07y91.jpg,"I am awful with liquid eyeliner - hands too shaky and well, I just am horrid with application in general. So what I will do is take a drop of water and add it to a bright eyeshadow.

Using and angled brush, or something small and dense, I will pick up the pigment to use as my eyeliner.

It a a bit more forgiving I have found for when I mess up and it can be a softer look / good intro into this.

The other thing I will do is if I am going for a bright or bold color, I will do a bit of primer on the lid - this helps to make the color pop and stay in place. A little bit of concealer or foundation works here but use very sparingly as those products can be a tad heavy and cause issues like creasing. 

A few things: just because a product is inexpensive does not mean it is not good and vice versa. Cost does not always equate to quality (I have inexpensive foundations that outlast higher end products). I will pay a bit more for a good skincare item over makeup but really, there are amazing skin care items on the market from places like The Ordinary which are so good. 

Sunscreen. Depending on where you live, and availability, etc., protect that beautiful skin of yours! You from the future will thank you for this. 

But the biggest thing I need to share with you. There. Are. No. Rules. 

Makeup is about expression. It’s an art form. It’s an extension of you. Get as creative as you want and have fun with it!

The only way we learn is through trial and error. I unfortunately learned the hard way that blush is not meant to be applied heavily… purple blush at that… but wouldn’t have known unless I tried. 

So get out there and have fun ♥️",7

I think a warm gold shadow would set off your eyes really nicely (it'll bring out the green more than the blue - go with more pink if you want to bring out blue), and it matches your complexion and hair color. If you want more subtle and less sparkle, a warm brown.Try keeping it on the lighter side on your lid, and then a pop of gold/brown on your orbital bone/crease - just inside the outside of your eye, if that makes any sense.

Those brows are absolutely bangin, but I think it'll look nice if you fill it in a little where they are thin on the outside.

4008,4008.0,4008.0,4008.0,,,,,,makeupeducation,Where can someone getting into makeup start?,84,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/y18sjk,"Hi! I’m a makeup artist that often does consults with people who are new to makeup or want to improve their collection/color palettes/knowledge of products, etc. I’m excited for you to dive into this world! I haven’t seen anyone mention this I don’t think:

Find your face shape, eye shape/placement, skin tone and undertone (warm/neutral/cool), and skin type (oily/dry/etc) by watching YouTube about it. Lots of “how to identify which  _____ you have”. That can then lead you to finding how-to videos that will cater specifically to the techniques, color palettes and placement of products that will best suit your specific face. From a skincare standpoint, knowing your skin type will help you include exclude products based on what they’re marketed for. Finding these specifics about yourself will help you avoid common makeup mistakes for newbies.

In addition, research what each brush does. This will allow you to figure out what brushes you’ll need in the very beginning. You don’t need many to start; as you discover your style preferences in application, you’ll know which ones you’ll need to acquire afterwards.

With building a basic makeup kit, focus on purchasing items at first that you’ll use the most often. Look for palettes you can use for multiple things, ie bronzer as shadow or palettes that have multiple product variations in them. 

Not everything needs to be, or should be expensive. Discovering your makeup style includes a lot of trying products you think you’ll like and end up not liking, for whatever reason. Drugstores and Ulta are your friend- and drugstore makeup quality has absolutely skyrocketed in the last few years. Start with a more inexpensive version (TikTok is incredible for finding drugstore dupes for expensive prestige brand products) and if you love it, maybe splurge on a more luxury one. Don’t feel the need to follow trends and quick-hype products.

Lastly, my only rule with makeup is: there are no rules. If something works for you, do it. No matter what content creators, professionals or fellow makeup lovers say- how YOU feel is the most important things.

Good luck!!",1

Purse your lips together to the point where you want to apply it, then try some blending techniques. You won't want an overly sharp line.  The goal would be to minimize the volume slightly.

So tinted moisturiser rather than thick foundation, golds and browns on the eyes and cheeks, maybe a whoosh of bronzer, and a pale brony-peach lipstick or lip gloss rather than a strong lip. Thin eyebrows too. Google 'top of the pops album covers 1970s' and you'll see what I mean.  Debbie Harry was the queen of makeup in the late-70s, but she wore a lot more eyeliner and colour for that punkier edge.

Based on what I've seen in magazine adverts and photographs from the time, this is what I've picked up on:

* Peachy blush/bronzer to contour and all over the cheek, and/or pink or berry toned blush [like this one](https://uk.morphe.com/products/perk-up-cheek-lip-color-pink-me-up) on the apples of your cheeks. Often they were worn together for a natural glowwy look. 
* On top of looking like a natural goddess you also want to look luminous, so use a sheer base or water-based foundation. 
   * You can even try subtle liquid highlighter in light pink or gold champagne 'sweat' style [like this one](https://www.revolutionbeauty.com/uk/en/makeup/face/highlighter/makeup-revolution-bright-light-highlighter-gold-lights/1555821.html) to assist with luminosity.
* The '70s had a lot of natural lip gloss [much like we have today](https://www.superdrug.com/make-up/lips/lip-plumping-gloss/maybelline-lifter-gloss-plumping-lip-gloss-moon/p/793465) and shimmery lipsticks. They could range from peachy, frosty pastel etc or can co-ordinate with your blusher/bronzer for a natural look. 
   * At night you can switch it up to a pearlescent cherry-berry toned lipstick, or deeper copper honey or coral tones.
* Daytime eyes have earthy shadow colours that we still use today such as shimmery brown and beige, as well as mascara on the upper and lower lashes. 
   * However, in the earlier half of the decade which was still heavily influenced by the playful '60s there was still a craze of pastel blues and pale lilacs etc with liquid black liner and statement lashes. You can even see that Diana Ross switched from this style to something more natural when the decades changed.
   * For a more demure look that is still in keeping with the natural '70s style you can add a brown eye liner pencil slightly smudged and smoked on the upper outer lash line.
   *  It was the disco decade. So at night you can glam up by using metallic, shimmery eyeshadows paired with fluffy or spidery false lashes for a late '70s Studio 54-ish look. [Jerry Hall](https://currentlycrushing.com/70s-inspiration-jerry-hall/) and [Donna Summer](https://www.pinterest.co.uk/pin/donna-summer--271130840051220254/) are good inspirations for this...
* Use a touch of vaseline and a toothbrush or spoolie to fluff and shape your eyebrows, nothing else unless you need an eyebrow pencil to fill in gaps for definition!
* Get a haircut that is reminiscent of the era that you're leaning towards. Fortunately the '70s was a decade with many different movements and subcultures, so there was a plethora of various haircuts ranging from long and short to suit every individuals' style and personality.
   *  If you the wavy hair that you have in the photograph is natural, you are already blessed and have little styling to do to achieve '70s hair. But it also depends on the way in which it's cut and shaped. Feathery wolf cuts or face-framing Curtain bangs which are on trend and are a nod to the '70s. Farah Fawcett is obviously a good start for general inspiration.
   * The '70s partially sought inspiration from the 1940s, particularly Hollywood hair or retro glam waves, There are curling and roller patterns [like this one](https://www.pinterest.co.uk/pin/398990848224906659/) if you want to keep your hair long.

I’m a physician- this pattern of bruising is a sign of a lower **SKULL FRACTURE**

It’s called ‘raccoon eyes’ and usually caused by a basilar skull fracture. Bruising starts 2-3 days after the trauma. ***It’s critical to get checked out at the ER*** they need to check for fracture and see how extensive it is, but most importantly, make sure you aren’t having a slow bleed in another compartment In the brain. You can be feeling fine initially with these types of bleeds then lose consciousness and die. Rly rly important and time sensitive to make sure that’s not going on.

I echo what everyone else said about seeking medical care and DV resources. I also know the reality that this job interview might be your ticket out and you still want/need to do it. Remember that the order of importance is: personal/physical safety ->important documents -> somewhere to stay/food to eat -> the ability to live long term. 

That being said, only use the makeup to hide it if it's for YOUR safety or YOUR freedom. These skills are not for his safety or protection, or to hide things from others. Abusers thrive in secret. He doesn't need to know you have these skills. 

You're going to want to go opposite the bruise color - yellow/peach/green color corrector depending on what color it is that day (it will change). There are little kits with multiple colors. Go in thin layers, and put a thin layer of concealer over it. Use bronzer - it will warm up areas that appear gray after the color correcting. Then a glowier foundation. Set it with a slightly glowy powder (like the ELF one). 

For your eyes, you can lean into it a bit - a thicker liner can help (but still professional - no big wings). Stick to black/brown for the eyes, anything pink or purple is going to emphasize redness. I had a weird eye problem a few months ago, and found that a smudgy eyeliner and a darker crease shade helped disguise similar eyelid issues. Then use a glowier shade on the center of the lid. Make sure your eyebrows are neat - draw the attention up and away from the under eye, or down and toward the lips.

A good bronzer/blush should help draw attention away - use warmer colors so it doesn't bring out the blue/red tones. Don't go overboard - this should be professional. 

Maybe a coral lip - with lots of shine. PUt the focus on your lips so the eye area is less obvious. Go warm and structured - use a lip liner.  Grab some makeup remover wipes so you can take it all off before you get home.

I hope this is your ticket out. If it is not - if you don't get the job, run (or just go directly to the hospital). DV centers can connect you with other jobs. While you're out at the interview, if you have a few dollars, get a burner phone (I think Walmart has them) and put it in your go bag with your important documents and a few changes of clothing. If it's this bad this time, how bad will it be next time? I'm concerned because this injury shows a pattern of escalation. It will continue to escalate. You're at the point where you need to get out before he kills you.",361

my thoughts: yes to dermablend, also estee lauder doublewear is a tried and true max-coverage foundation. but before foundation, color correct. the bruising will change color with time so my suggestion would be to get a creamy color correcting palette- nyx makes a great and affordable one. 

the palette is important because it'll have a variety of colors you can mix and match-- you'll want to reference a color wheel on google images, approximate the color of the bruising, then apply the color all the way across the wheel from it (180 degrees). Finding the ""opposite"" color this way --red's opposite is green, for example-- is the most precise way to neutralize discoloration. 

for additional coverage (even works great on eyelids) i recommend tarte shape tape concealer; either the normal formula or the hydrating formula depending on whether you're dry or oily. it comes in less expensive mini tubes as well, check ulta. finally, after all this concealing, don't forget about a pop of blush to return some color to the face.

good luck with everything",878

I'll go a different direction. Is this interview virtual or in person? If it's virtual, you have a bit more flexibility with things like the room lighting. You can test how you'll appear on screen with your makeup, different settings, and different lighting ahead of time.

Virtually or in person, glasses - real, blue light, or otherwise - with larger, thicker frames could also help mask the appearance. Setting your makeup is critical if you go this route, because the last thing you want is your makeup rubbed off by the glasses. If you have time, do a test run today to make sure it works as intended. 
 
I saw you mentioned something about a limited budget. Due to the extenuating circumstances, I was going to suggest buying dermablend from a place that has a generous return policy. That doesn't sit well with me, so instead, I'd like to ask if I can Venmo you a little bit of cash to help ease the financial burden. Maybe others here would be willing to pitch in as well. Totally understandable if you don't want to accept this kind of help if it might potentially aggravate your situation.

For the makeup id use a yellow color corrector and then an opaque concealer, juvias place has some pretty good options which u can find at a store like ulta, another cheaper option would be loreals infallible. It can look cakey after a bit but it will get the job done, then use the most opaque foundation u have and some translucent powder to keep it down, it might look like alot so a dewy finishing spray might take away from the cakey look if u like dewy finishes, and then id add some white highligter or shimmery eyehadow in the inner corner of ur eyes to make them look brighter.

Onto makeup. 
It looks like your bruise it at different stages of healing so I suggest getting a colour corrector with a few options in it (I know NYX did one) on the yellowish use a purple, on the darker reddish areas use great. You may also want to go around the edges with a peachy colour. 
Set that with a tiny amount of powder. Then a thick foundation or if you already have a foundation you like try something like elf camo concealer just around the eye area (it's thicker and full coverage concealer) use a nice highlight in the inner corner to brighten the whole look up",50

I know this will probably be buried, but I just want to share something really quickly. 

I lost my dad to suicide about 10 years ago. After, I fell into the deepest, darkest depression for a couple of years because I felt like it was my fault. He used to tell me if it weren’t for me, he’d kill himself. I distanced myself for my own mental health, and that’s when he completed suicide. 

So much happened that I won’t share unless you’d like to talk about it, but long story short: I got into an abusive relationship, probably because I had no sense of self-worth and honestly felt suicidal anyway. I knew the guy was messed up. I stayed for too long, until one day, he put his hands around my throat and wouldn’t let go. By the grace of God, he let go because someone banged on the locked bedroom door. It was my chance to get away. 

I had bruises. Not this bad, but I remember wearing turtle necks to hide the swelling in my throat and discoloration. I went to the doctor (thankfully, no permanent damage). I fell deeper into a hole of despair, but I realized that I NEEDED help or I would end up back in that situation again, and the next time, I might not survive. 

You are SO brave to know you have to get out. I am SO proud of you for being courageous enough to say, fuck these bruises, I’m going to get myself back in the saddle despite my grief and my pain. I hope you see a doctor for the immediate injuries, but more than that, I hope you leave and NEVER go back to whoever did this to you. 

Losing your brother is not your fault, just like losing my dad wasn’t mine. It took years to believe that, but I promise, if you get help (support groups saved me) you can liberate yourself too. It’s so hard carrying around the kind of grief that suicide leaves us with. I promise it’s not forever, and I promise that you deserve to live better than this. You deserve to know love, and support, and unconditional compassion, just as you gave your brother who undoubtedly left this world knowing—if nothing else—that he has a sister who would do anything for him. What a blessing that is, to know that kind of love. He would want you to give yourself that same love, too.

There is hope. This is not the end for you. This is the beginning of a brave new chapter where you can reinvent yourself into the person you deserve to be.  I know because I have been in your shoes, and yet today, I’m happily married, expecting my first baby in a matter of weeks, and I just recently passed the bar exam. Im HAPPY. And, so so so loved and supported by the village that I found after those dark days. 

I am sending so much love and light, my friend. Please reach out if I can be of any support. Keep being brave. You’ve got this.",16

I would also advise you to use any local resources at your disposal. They are put in place to help people in your situation, you have been so strong already and deserve some help. Don't be afraid to use it.

Contact local DV centers, some of these places have makeup, clothes , shoes etc that can be borrowed specifically to help women get into work. They may also know of hair, beauty and dry cleaners that do free services or cheaper services. Often local students need models and will give discounted prices for colours and cuts or makeovers.

I’d recommend a product like Ben Nye Corrector Wheel since your bruises are at different stages of healing, some fading into yellowish brown, while others are still quite red/deep purple almost blue-black. 

The key is to neutralize opposites. 
-Green corrector cancels out redness. 
-Yellow corrector cancels out black and blue. 
-Lavender corrector for brownish and yellowing bruises. 

Then follow with your foundation of choice, I’d go with a medium-full coverage powder to set the cream concealer. If you have combination skin, Patrick Starrr’s One/Size has a pretty good quality powder foundation and the coverage is buildable to full. I would keep the rest of your face makeup simple, just brows, blush, and lips for a polished/professional first impression. A tinted brow gel/pomade like Milani is a good drugstore product. For blush and lips, you can actually use a multipurpose tint or even lipstick. 

Good luck! Wishing you strength and healing!",27

In addition to using makeup, please consider also making sure that you take care of the health of your skin as well, that will help speed up healing and make your skin that isn’t bruised look healthy. 

1. Ice or cold packs—make sure you’re not doing more than 15 mins and wrap in a towel. You can alternate on off. 
2. Lots of water
3. Actually weird but the bromelaine in pineapple can help with bruise healing. 
4. NSAIDs or Tylenol for swelling
5. Aloe Vera gel on the bruises to soothe.",11

First few days (while still swollen):

**AM & PM**

\- Ice pack 20 min on/10 off for about an hour

\- Cover a cotton swab w/ Witch Hazel and apply for 5 minutes

\- Rub/Rest a pineapple chunk on under-eye for about 5 minutes 

\- Apply Arnicare Bruise Cream

\- About 30 minutes later, apply DerMend Moisturizing Bruise Formula

**MIDDAY**

\-Repeat but without Dermend (this product should only be used twice a day maximum)

After the swelling went down, I switched to light heat compression/massaging in place of the ice packs, but would only do the warm compress for about 5 min on/5 min off for a couple of times. 

I ate a TON of pineapple, dark berries, and leafy greens, and honestly **once I started using the Dermend, it got SO much better**. It can be found at CVS or on Amazon. And make sure to HYDRATE. 

Obviously, makeup is your friend, but don't forget we live in a world where wearing a facial mask is not absurd. I wore a mask to work and just told my co-workers I wasn't feeling 100%, no questions were asked. You could easily wear a mask to this interview and just let them know you were just exposed or you're not feeling totally great but you really wanted to make the interview!

Do you need any interviewing tips? Is it a zoom type interview or in person? I find it really helpful to look up interview questions and answers for the position you're applying for, a quick Google should help, and to go over them out loud. Also to write out any examples, some bullet points on why you're applying, what you know about the company, challenges you've overcome with others, something you're proud of accomplishing and how you did it, some strengths and weaknesses. Just some bullet points that you can't reflect on during the interview. If it's in person you can bring a folder with extra copies of your resume, and one for yourself and write the bullet points on your copy, or affix with sticky notes (you can check them during the interview unless they say otherwise, it's not cheating it shows that you are prepared and that you would be prepared on the job there!), you can also bring any copies of certificates, accomplishments (but only copies in case they went to keep them).  I also note down a couple questions I would ask them at the end of the interview, given they haven't already answered them (they can be more specific to your role, or generic like ""how is the team structured? How would you measure the success of this position? What are some sort term vs longer term goals for this position? What would you say your management style is? ) And then my last question is always, ""Given everything we have discussed, do you have any concerns about me filing this role?"" This question is hard to ask, but trust me, just do it. It usually throws them off guard and they can tell you right then and there any issues they see that you now have a chance to respond to and correct I have had a person say, ""we will ask discuss this and let you know blahblah"" but that is quite rare. They're usually helpful.

And always be likable. I know this sounds silly, but when interviewees are nervous they can forget to keep things light. ""It's great to meet you"" laugh, smile, look like you like talking to them, and remember to thank them at the end!

Those are pretty much the sum of my tips. I hope there was at least one tiny nugget of help in there for you. You have got this!!!",20

First, do not cover up your bruises/wounds if your skin is broken or very fragile, you risk infection and permanent skin damage on top of the other risks outlined but other commenters. I say do the interview with no makeup, if you can, and focus on how you present yourself, non-visually. Given your current situation, I imagine that is much easier said than done, so if you do decide to cover, please proceed with caution.

Second, if you’re gonna do makeup, call Sephora or Mac in your area if you have either, I’m sure people on this sub have opinions about both brands, but, I know both have had programs in the past to help women in need.

I also had to conceal, heal, and spin elaborate yet somewhat believable short-term explanations for anything that showed through. 

1. [Speed up the healing time ](https://www.healthline.com/health/bruised-face#overnight-treatment). Time is, unfortunately, the only real cure, but I second, third, fourth all the people who said arnica - gel worked best for me because I found that it sank in quickest. There are a lot of things on the list at the link that you won't have to go out and buy, since you may already have them at home or in products you already have. 



2. Color correction! Peach is going to help correct the blue/purple you have right now, and the [NYX color correcting palette](https://www.nyxcosmetics.ca/en/face/color-correct/color-correcting-palette-NYX_171.html) is great for that - plus you have the options of other corrector colors as the bruises change. When they fade out to green/yellow, you may want to go heavier on the pink - so a little more of the drops. 

This is hard to figure out from a description alone - [WikiHow has a step by step](https://www.wikihow.com/Cover-a-Bruise-on-Your-Face?amp=1).



3. Application: When you apply the color corrector, let it set and dry before you apply your regular base - I kept smearing it on like a maniac and it just made everything worse. Bounce your regular foundation on lightly with a sponge or your fingertips instead of doing swiping motions or the whole thing is going to turn into a watercolor painting. 



4. Set the layers: once you put on the color corrector, mist on your setting spray. Let it dry. Put on your base/foundation, mist that with your setting spray, let it dry. 



5. Pick some part of your face that isn't your eyes and highlight it. I went bold on lips so there was something dramatic about my face to look at, and that was 100% a distraction technique. My thought process was that if anyone looked at me and felt like something was making them take a second look, having a distinct ""lip"" at least made it plausible that that's what they were seeing first. Did it work? Maybe. I got a lot of compliments on my lipstick.",21

Please follow the wonderful advice left here by other commenters regarding seeking medical advice and DV resources that can help you get out of the situation you're in. 

My mother worked in a corporate office while going through similar things at home, and this is how she covered the bruising for work. She mainly used a combo of the ""sticky base"" routine and color correcting.

You'll first want to start with a sticky serum and primer combo to lock everything in place. The hyaluronic acid serum from the ordinary and elf hydrogrip primer are great affordable options for this. Give it a few moments to set before starting with the makeup. Then, you'll need to color correct using shades opposite on the color wheel of the bruising. From the picture, it looks like you've got a lot of red/purple, so I'd use green and yellow color correctors. Green on top of the red, yellow on top of the purple. Nyx and LA girl make great affordable color correctors in these shades. Lay down a *thin* layer of the color correctors and slightly blend out the edges with a brush. I wouldn't touch the middle, as you don't want to move that product around. Once you've applied enough that the red/purple tones are being blocked out, stop there and let that corrector sit for a good 5 minutes to fully set in and dry down. You can also apply a thin layer of setting powder on top to really lock it in. Once the corrector has fully set, go in with a shade of concealer that's a shade *darker* than your skin tone. I know that this sounds ridiculous especially around the eyes, but trust me. Going in with a shade darker will help to cover the corrector. Again, only blend out the edges and let that layer fully set down as well. You can also apply a thin layer of translucent setting powder at this step. Lastly, take a *very* small amount of a brightening concealer, maybe one-two shades lighter than your skin tone. Place one dot right underneath your tearduct/inner corner, and one right under your outer corner. To bled this out, I'd recommend using a sponge or your finger. This will be the top layer, so you'll want it to be really smooth and blended out. Once it's blended out, go over it with a final layer of translucent powder, or (for a little more coverage) a foundation powder. For extra staying powder, you can really wet down everything with a mattifying setting spray and allow it to fully dry down.

The most important things to remember are being tactful with your amount and placement of the products. More product does not always equal more coverage, and excessive product can make things more obvious. Thin thin thin layers, light blending of the edges, and fully allowing each layer to set before applying the next are the most important steps to covering bruising. I hope this helps 🥺",5

Use a nude pallet and give it a bit more life to match your skin tone then use foundation.

[EDIT: please go to a hospital and get medical help and have the injury documented. Have a police statement taken in preparation for protection order.] If you were in my country I could get legal help for you. I am sorry, I may not be able to help you medically but I can give help by way of tips for job interview:

1. Give a good walkthrough of your resume/cv by explaining your job history, roles, and responsibilities. A good candidate does not need to be prompted with questions on job roles and responsibilities because this shows the interviewer that the candidate knows his roles/duties and has mastered his or her previous job responsibility by being able to explain the processes/duties well. A good introduction is where you are able sell your abilities as a candidate. I once had a candidate give a 20 minute walkthrough of process and accountabilities in resume job history. Although candidate came from different field I understood the walkthrough and did not have to do any prompting. 

2. Do not lie. Transparency and accountability is very important. A resume/cv can book an interview but getting the job takes competency, good professional demeanor, and accountability. I have had instances where I did not extend the job to a competent applicant because there were characted red flags.

3. Be yourself. Have confidence in your abilities and all the hard work you have done. 

4. Do not talk bad about previous employers. This is a red flag. 

5. If faced with situational questions, this is good because the interviewer wants to see your thinking process. If you have not yet encountered the situation, give an answer as to what you would do and explain why you chose a certain way to solve it. If asked about failures, you should be able to do a post-mortem why you did not succeed and what lessons have you learned—this would show the interviewer that you are able to accept mistakes and learn. 

Good luck on your interview and I hope you will be in a better situation and have complete healing from your injuries.",5

The EL is a bit drier.  The EL successfully covered several dark purple red blood blister I got from a bad IPL tx when nothing else did the trick.  The Smashbox wasn't available back then, but I've used it for some pretty horrific cystic pimples and it is amazing.  I layer - use a creamy concealer/foundation 1st, let dry.  Pat on the EL or the Smashbox in thin layers over that, then pat on powdered foundation as a final step.  May look cakey but should cover it.  Do you have glasses you can also wear over this as well?  Might help.

I note that it is probably the fact that you had a good job interview coming up that caused the loser who did this to you to do this.  He is sabotaging your life and any efforts you make to better your life in any way he can.  He does not care for you, if he did, he wouldn't bust your face up and try to kill you right before a job interview.  I know you are trying to leave, I hope you are able to ASAP.

Im sorry and would be so grateful,11392,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/yh7ifm,"[Colour correction](https://youtu.be/gyS7cuXNIDI) before foundation( wait until color correction dries up, gently tap in foundation over it, do not smudge like if you put cream on face or how you may generally use foundation on healthy skin). For example, redness is covered by green color, and green would be corrected by red. It can vary depending on a color wheel you look at and undertone of the color targeted, can be a lot of trial and error. Same applies to hair toning, for example. 

Take a look at [color wheel](https://www.provenwinners.com/sites/provenwinners.com/files/images/articles/color-wheel_0.jpg) and choose opposing color to neutralize.

Yellow seems to cover purple, based on color correction products description online. There is a variety of products.

Bottom line, only a full coverage foundation can Somewhat cover it without color correction.

Before buying color correction products, **remember** that purple will change into green and then yellow eventually, so you need a whole range of color corrective concealers, not just one color for current purple.

Good luck on the interview.",3

First I’d recommend going to any store that sells a lot of makeup ask for a full coverage concealer (they usually can help u pick out the best shade for u) and ask for a colour corrector (idk if u live in Canada but Lise watier has a rlly good pallet with diff colours but also I believe Nyx has one that might be a bit cheaper) (also smashboxXbecca’ new colour correctors r good too but so pricey) 


Ur bruise will need more than just one colour corrector 
(Using a colour wheel will help u with know how to neutralize the colours) examples: 
green neutralizes red 
blue neutralizes orange
Purple neutralizes yellow 

So for example on the sides you have a bit of green that can be covered by red and the purple can be covered by yellow don’t put too much of the colour concealer just enough to cancel out a bit of the colour 

Then with ur full coverage concealer (can be any good concealer I’d recommend a hydrating one instead of matte) with a brush or a makeup sponge  blend the concealer and then top it with RLLY RLLY little bit of powder (pressed powder in my opinion because it’s not as drying and overpowering as loose but still does the job of keeping the makeup in place) 

I’d also recommend putting a rlly rlly good hydrating cream and eye cream to help the makeup stay and not crease 

I’m not a professional or anything but I worked at shoppers in the cosmetics area and this is what I know 

Please correct me 
I know my information may not be accurate but I hope this helps

Sometimes white can be a lil off putting on deeper skin. But for the event and context I could understand why. The base is absolutely gorgeous and skin like and the lips really fit I like how it’s the perfect undertone. Her smile adds the cherry on top and her dress is STUNNING,379

The love you have for your SO is palpable and fills me with joy!  

I can see you have plenty of advice about the eyes. I wanted to add that for darker skinned women, often bright and light coloured lipsticks can look very jarring. One excellent way to mitigate this (that I use myself) is to line the lips with a more darker, often neutral (close to skin tone or a smidge darker) lipliner. 

While isn't not ""Barbie"" per se, it makes these colours look infinitely more flattering on dark skin.

So for this look I would have gone with a deeep brown (maybe even one that had a hint of red) as a lipliner. Then applied the bright pink lipstick and blended till it looked right. 



Just a reiteration though that I absolutely love your posts and am looking forward to the next beautiful look from you and your SO! 

Good job :)))

Edit: I'll also say looking at the photo that the eyeliner on top of the eyes isn't that bad - the eyeliner on the bottom of the eyes is way too harsh though - for this look I would have skipped the liquid eyeliner on the bottom of the eyes (tbh, I've never seen liquid liner on the bottom of the eyes look good) and opted for a bright, berry pink colour very tight in the lower lash line and added some pink or gold for some inner corner highlight!",3

The higher the contrast, and the more graphic the design... the more it shows every imperfection.

In this case, the thickness and position of the white line looks messy instead of striking.

It's like white socks with black shoe. On a very talented dancer, it draws the eye to the flashy moves...

But if you don't do it perfect, it shows every misstep.... and it would be better to wear black shoes with black tights.

Here, additional black eyeliner would have been a better choice, especially considering the non-ideal prep location and timeline.

They have a gorgeous warm smile, that would be a better (safer) feature to play up considering the pressure.",2

in many looks it closes the eye off. my personal rule of thumb is to keep it to the outer third until you’re more confident. 

I would also suggest using a softer hand with the eyebrows, but honestly this is my opinion more than anything else.

Have you looked at the wing eyeliner stamps? They're just eyeliner pens that have the normal pointed tip on one end and a stamp on the other end to do the cat eye. One pen for each eye. I have shaky hands so it's normally very hard for me to do wings, and these have been a game changer for me. I get mine from Amazon for like $12 for the set.",129

5318,,,,,,,,,makeupaddiction,"My SO is blind and I do her makeup, practicing better wings and understanding her eye structure!",7402,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/x89vl6,"OP, thank you and your partner for sharing this publicly. It’s a very moving example of what love looks like. Beyond your natural talent and improvement over time, she is just radiant in these photos and the ones you shared earlier. You can see in her demeanor how beautiful this makes her feel. 

My grandmother is physically disabled from contracting polio in her teens. I can’t speak perfectly on her behalf or generally on the behalf of other disabled folks, but her physical appearance has always been very important to her. She can’t hide that’s she’s disabled, ever. Maybe some people mistake it as vanity, but it’s one of the few things she can still control in spite of her physical limitations. It was how she learned to cope with the societal stigma she faced as a disabled woman in the 1950s. She’s told me numerous times that she was either treated (in her words) “like a piece of furniture” or “gawked at”. Her beauty regimen and personal style were and still are her way to help people to see her as a whole person, not the limitations of her body. 

My grandfather helped her build a life where her personhood was at the center. He was a lifeline to help her navigate a world that was not designed for her to thrive. They had a deep understanding and commitment to each other’s needs that I think ultimately made their marriage a loving and happy one. I see a lot of parallels in your relationship with your partner, and it’s very comforting to see a bright spot in the deluge of confusing and heartbreaking information we’re constantly bombarded with. 

I hope whether you keep sharing or not that this continues to strengthen the bond you and your partner have and brings shared sense of joy.",32

I’ve done them like this for years bc of body dysmorphia, but wanna know if it looks silly.",7297,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/z9qn6u,"I’m a straight guy so I think I am unbiased about makeup. At first glance (when I saw the thumbnail) I looked at your lashes and thought they were noticeably long, in the same sort of way you notice someone’s bright blue eyes or something like that. Your looks grabbed attention and the eyelashes kept my attention, so if that’s the reaction you’re going for it worked. But I have a little bit more of an answer that explains the full thought process that went through my head.

If I saw you in public I would think “She’s really pretty. Look at how long her eyelashes are.” In that order. I didn’t think much of the length of them as I looked at the rest of your makeup. I thought that you have the amount of makeup on that I would expect to see on someone at a nice restaurant. I obviously don’t have a critical eye like a woman would, but your makeup looks like it’s done very well to me and I would also remember that. But after looking at your lashes again, I have to say they are just a little bit past some imaginary threshold in my mind where they elicit a remark. I obviously have a minority opinion here since so many of the comments are supportive and appear envious of the length of your lashes, but that’s why I decided to comment.

At a quick glance I’d think those things above, but if we spoke in person- had an actual conversation that includes eye contact- I feel like I would have noticed them and devoted mental energy into not making it known that I find them unique and “mentionable”. To me they are your defining feature to such an extent that they perhaps overshadow how pretty you are- they don’t take away from your looks, they’re just prominent. I would not mention them if we had a face to face conversation for the same reason I wouldn’t mention a Basketball player’s height, nor would I ask a doctor what the grossest thing they ever saw was. I would think you were tired of talking about them, so I would be mindful of that and have it in my head as we spoke as a topic to avoid.

Hopefully that helps give a different perspective.",2

You look gorgeous, and by no means the worst offender in terms of spider lashes, but this would be the length that looks absurd on Facebook or in any other context aside from makeup forums and Instagram, and is often distracting (positively or negatively depending on technique) in IRL. 

You have *such* naturally gorgeous features, a sheer glowy base and cream blush plus a brown mascara (not fiber, not lengthening, not black except for formal looks) and a light or nude lip is all you need to showcase that, facially, you've won the genetic lottery. 

I get the body issues. It's hard to accept that not everything needs to be better or improved but some things are good just how they are and that's all.

Edit: Another option would be to do away with the black liquid liner and go with a brown smudge stick instead. The liner is making it look a lot heavier and stark than they actually are, nixing it would make them distracting irl but in a less intentional way.",2
