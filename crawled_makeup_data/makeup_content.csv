In her 75 years, Sandy Linter has lived many lives as a makeup artist.
In 1969, the Brooklyn-born, Staten Island–bred visionary began her career working for famed celebrity hairdresser Mr. Kenneth Battelle in New York City, his clients Jackie Onassis and Barbara Walters serendipitously ending up in her makeup chair. In the ’70s, she struck out on her own, landing high-profile editorial work with photographers such as Irving Penn, Helmut Newton, and Arthur Elgort while embodying the era’s work-hard-play-hard mentality and becoming a dazzling fixture at Studio 54. And by the ’80s, she was regularly painting the faces of supermodels Iman, Cindy Crawford, and Patti Hansen for major campaigns and in the pages of Vogue. Since then, Linter hasn’t slowed down. In fact, with age, her skillset has grown, as she’s continued to work with a laundry list of famous faces including Christie Brinkley, Elizabeth Hurley, Debbie Harry, and Rita Wilson.
“I can remember being ‘young Sandy the makeup artist’ and then middle-aged and then further on than middle-aged...” she laughs, in reference to her personal evolution over her decades-long career. At a time when the fashion industry is, at long last, celebrating women above a certain age, Linter believes there’s no time like the present for older women to not just embrace makeup, but have fun with it. “There are no rules!” she insists, with just one addendum: “Wear the makeup, don’t have it wear you. Instead of trying to hide flaws, enhance what you’ve got.”

You’ll be able to learn the basic trends of Korean makeup and how to do it without needing professional techniques.
What is the Korean makeup look?

A post shared by Hyekyo Song (@kyo1122)
To understand what the “Korean makeup look” is, just observe pictures of popular female Korean celebrities such as Song Hye Kyo and Krystal from f(x). Notice anything in common?
It is their flawless complexion, dewy skin, and youthful vibe that really makes the “Korean look” so desirable to just about everyone across Asia! They keep their makeup look natural too, so they always look effortlessly gorgeous.
To help you achieve the look, we’ve put together a quick and easy Korean makeup tutorial that even beginners can follow along with.
Suggested read: 8 out of 10 readers awarded this renewed popular micellar water 5 out of 5 stars – here’s why they love it
1. Prep your skin by moisturising it
The Koreans are most famous for their dewy, radiant skin – but it is not created entirely with highlighters and high coverage foundation!
The key to achieving Korean ‘glass skin’ is actually making sure that your skin is moisturised and hydrated – or ‘chok chok’ as they call it in Korea. Hence, it is important to always moisturise your skin in the day and night. If your skin is on the dry side, you can consider using a leave-on night mask cream that will give you the extra moisture boost that you need.
If you still struggle to find a moisturiser that works for you, check out the following guides we created for you:
20 facial moisturisers that are the missing ingredient to your skincare routine
13 best moisturisers for combination skin with raves from reviewers

7 ways to make your moisturiser work harder for you
Regular misting is another way to make sure that your skin remain hydrated and radiant. Consider investing in a good facial mist that you can carry around with you in your bag or leave at your work desk.
Koreans prefer to do more natural makeup, hence they focus a lot more on skincare that can give them radiant, glowing skin even without BB cream.
That is why it is important to build a skincare routine that works for you first, before learning how to do Korean makeup looks.
If you are completely new to skincare, why not take a few tips from your favourite Korean celebs to achieve their flawless look – for example, did you know that ASTRO’s Cha Eun Woo has an elaborate skincare routine?
2. Suncare
This is one of the most important steps for any makeup tutorial, especially when the sun is an unavoidable element in Singapore’s tropical climate.
Many Koreans, place huge importance on protecting their skin from UV rays. That is why you will see that many K-beauty brands carry facial sunscreens. Even famous Korean makeup artists such as Pony and Risabae have often talked about the importance of using sunscreens, and their makeup tutorials will always include one step for sun care.
There are many reasons why you might be tempted to skip this step in your routine: some think it’s unnecessary since many foundations and BB creams nowadays come with SPF, while others simply don’t like that tacky feeling that some sunscreen formulations leave behind.
Either way, we strongly recommend applying sunscreen before you do any makeup, just to really make sure you’re fending off all those harmful UV rays which will make your skin age faster.
Sunscreens also come in different textures and finishes, so don’t give up on finding one that works for you and your makeup routine. If you need help finding a sunscreen that doesn’t feel sticky in Singapore’s weather, you can check out this helpful list.
Another thing to take note: you have to reapply sunscreen! Sunscreen cannot actually protect you for the whole day, so it’s important that you reapply it once every two hours if you are out in the hot sun.
Also, don’t miss out areas like your eyelids, undereye, neck, and ears. These areas are often neglected but it’s important to protect them in order to prevent skin cancer and uneven skin tone!
3. BB cream or cushion compacts
Since the main aim of this Korean makeup tutorial is to be quick and easy, we recommend that you check out BB cream or cushion compacts if you haven’t already done so.
Both combine makeup and skincare into one convenient formula, so you’d be able to moisturise your skin while applying foundation and concealer at the same time.
The small, all-in-one packaging of BB cushions are especially handy if you’re the sort that travels frequently, or just want to touch up your makeup on the go!
BB cream has been one of the most sought-after makeup products when it first emerged in the Korean beauty scene, and it’s since made waves all around the world. If you are looking for something lightweight but which can also cover blemishes, you can use BB cream in place of foundation and concealer.
Another thing to take note is that some K-beauty BB creams and cushion compacts work better for Korea’s seasonal weather. If you need help finding one that can work for your skin type in Singapore’s humid weather, we have a guide for you.
Cushion compacts are slightly more popular than BB creams in 2022, and while many people love using it, there are a significant number of people who also get the application method wrong.
Use the patting motion to apply cushion. This will prevent streaking and give you a dewy look.
If you still prefer liquid foundation, choose a hydrating formula. Start by applying a light layer of foundation – just enough to cover your entire face with a thin layer. Then, build it up slowly by focusing on areas that require more coverage.
This method ensures that your final look will be airy and lightweight – exactly what you see on your favourite Korean stars.
DV Tip: When applying BB cream or BB cushions, work under natural light, such as near a window. You’ll be better able to see exactly how much of the product you are applying on your face and this can prevent you from accidentally piling on too much coverage. Always remember to extend your base makeup past your neckline for a more natural look.
4. Concealer
Many of us aren’t blessed with perfect skin, but that’s okay because there is always concealer to save your day.
To achieve that flawless complexion, you’ll probably need something a little more intense for those stubborn blemishes that are still slightly visible even after using base makeup. It can also hide those dark eye circles, acne scars, or even redness on your skin.
If you want to make your cheekbones and nose more prominent, you can also use concealer as a highlighter. Opt for a concealer that is one shade lighter, and apply it as you would with highlighter.
But take note that concealer is not always necessary in a Korean makeup look. If you don’t have significant blemishes, instead of using a concealer, simply pat on a little more foundation on the targeted area. This way, your makeup will be less likely to cake.

5. Eye makeup
In Korea, eye makeup is also known as point makeup as they want their eyes to be the main “point” on their face.
Some of the distinctive Korean eye makeup looks include the “puppy eyes” eyeliner and aegyo sal (cute eye bags below your eyes) – check out our beginner’s guide on how to do Korean eye makeup!
For eyeshadow, Koreans prefer to keep colours on the eyelids to a minimum as they prefer a more natural look rather than having makeup too obviously piled on. As such, it is recommended that you use neutral or light colours, such as brown, pink, or coral. 
A tip for choosing the right eye shadow is to explore and find colours that suit your skin tone. Head over to drugstores or Sephora and swatch different shades of eye shadows to find shade that complements or accentuates your eyes.

Many Koreans prefer to use brown eyeliner as it will give you a softer and more natural look, since black eyeliner can look harsh and fierce. To achieve the puppy eyes look, line your eyes in such a way that the outer end extends outwards and downwards, instead of upwards (which is done in cat-eye looks).
Eyelid tape is another tool you can count on to make your peepers stand out. You can also look younger with anti-ageing eyelid tape, which is why it is so popular among beauty enthusiasts.
Many Asian women lament about having short and straight eyelashes, but that’s what eyelash curlers and mascaras are for. Choose a mascara that is waterproof and smudge-proof to prevent yourself from looking like a panda nearer the end of the day.
DV Tip: Use a lash primer or mascara fixer so that your curled lashes will be held in place for the entire day.
6. Brows

Did you know that brows play a huge role in shaping your face? Another element to the youthful, innocent Korean look is to have straight brows with a slight arc at the end. If you look at pictures of Korean female celebrities, you will notice how they tend to draw their brows in a straight manner!
However, these days you will find that fewer Korean female celebrities spot straight brows, but opt instead for a more natural arch that frames their face. Bae Suzy, for example, has replaced her straight brows with naturally curved ones:

Whichever you prefer, you have to remember that brow shapes look different on everyone. You can check out our article on the different types of eyebrows and how to draw your eyebrows easily here.
If you are confident that the Korean straight brow is for you, you can attempt to pluck away those stray hairs and slowly shape it. However, if you doubt your own skills, you can always entrust your brows to beauticians in eyebrow salons and let them know the shape you wish to have.

The next step is to fill in your brows. Begin with light strokes at the start of your brows and slowly work your way to the end, tapering it down to a point. You can choose to work with a eyebrow pencil or eyebrow powder, whichever you’re more comfortable with.
Even if you are going for a straight eyebrow look, there should still be a very slight arc near the end of the brow, and the arc should begin around the outer corner of your eye.Remember to blend out any harsh edges with a spoolie.
Some Koreans also like to use eyebrow tints to lighten their brow colour so that it will match their skin and hair colour better, especially if they have dyed their hair a much lighter colour. Give it a try and you may be surprised with the result!
7. Blush

Now that we are done with your base makeup, we need to add some healthy glow back onto the face. To do so, you can use powder, cream, or liquid blushers, depending on your preference! For beginners, we recommend using powder blushers as they are generally easier to blend.
Apply them from high points of your cheeks (commonly termed as the apples of your cheeks) towards your temples and blend it to look as if the glow is coming naturally from within. In Korea, women prefer to use blushers in the shade of coral and rosy pink as it complements their skin tone.
Don’t be afraid to apply more colour as well – although the Koreans advocate for natural makeup, they do like more colour payoff with their blushes so that they get a healthy, radiant glow!
But if you’re new to blusher, consider starting with a smaller amount of product first, and slowly build it up. It’s always easier to add on than to remove. Feel free to use your fingers – instead of a brush – to blend out the pigment too. Most newbies find it easier to control the product when they get hands-on.
8. Lips

A post shared by 3CE Official Instagram (@3ce_official)
The gradient lip makeup trend has taken over the world but it actually originated from Korea. It makes your lips look fuller, and also makes them look tantalisingly just-bitten. The basic principle behind a gradient lip is to use a darker shade on the inner lips, and then use a lip brush, a cotton bud, or your finger to blend it outwards to create a gradient effect.
Gradient lips have become so popular that many Korean makeup brands (and even non-Korean brands) have come up with two-tone lipsticks which claim to help you achieve the gradient look with one swipe and without blending.
For a step-by-step tutorial on how to get gradient lips, you can read our article here.
DV Tip: Lightly pat a tiny bit of concealer over your lips before you begin doing your gradient lips. This will make the colour and the gradient look more obvious from the contrast! You can also choose to top off your gradient lips with a clear lip gloss to give your lips a juicy, succulent look."

Posted by Jbeauty Collection on November 09, 2022
When it comes to makeup, the Japanese have their own unique aesthetic and the techniques to achieve it. The ideal finish has an all-over soft and luminous glow, that feels both natural and youthful. Japanese makeup looks tend to be subtle with occasional color accents that cast a sweet and innocent girl-next-door charm. Let’s take a look at the essential steps to achieve the “no makeup makeup look”.
First things first: Skincare
Skincare is always a top priority in any J-Beauty makeup routine since it helps makeup go on smoother as well as protects the skin from irritation and dryness. In fact, we could say that how your makeup turns out depends 100% on the condition of your skin, so a clean yet hydrated canvas is a must before proceeding to makeup application. When you’re not skin ready, your makeup can end up flaky, cakey, and uneven, so skipping skin prep would be putting the cart before the horse. At the same time, your routine shouldn’t be so overly complicated that you’re tempted to skip it and go straight to the eyeliner. J-Beauty skincare routines are simple, beginning with a gentle cleanse followed by essence, emulsion, and moisturizing steps.
Face
American makeup can get quite intricate in the quest for flawless skin – there’s a wide variety of full-coverage and sheer foundations, powders, concealers, brushes, beauty blenders, and other products, depending on the type of look you’re seeking. Although Japan also has its fair share of products, Japanese face makeup or “base makeup” tends to be simpler, with BB creams, CC creams, and tinted moisturizers, and cushion compacts favored over heavy foundations. More on the nitty gritty of J-Beauty CC and BB creams here. Highlighter and contouring are less popular, but powders are sometimes used to brighten the under eyes and mattify the T-zone.
Since the idea is to create a Suhada or your-skin-but-better effect that looks fresh and effortless, you’ll often see Japanese face makeup products geared towards creating a luminous glow or “toumeikan.” It’s pretty much the polar opposite of baking makeup, a popular technique in the west for achieving flawless full glam. Both baking and Suhada promise skin that appears lightweight and glowing with a smooth matte texture, but the methods and products involved couldn’t be more different.
Eyebrows
Brows are a must in J-Beauty makeup routines, as they shape the face and determine the overall tone of the makeup. Dramatic, dark, and sharp brows are usually avoided, as they can look unnatural. Japanese women tend to prefer a soft look, so they fill in their brows by following their natural arch, with a brow shade that complements their hair color.
Eyes
Japanese people aim to enhance their eye shape with their eye makeup. You won’t see any smokey eyes here. They love to blend shimmery eyeshadows with more natural shades on the lids, as well as coat their lower lash lines with shimmer for a wide-eyed effect. When it comes to eyeliner, they tend to favor a simple thin line or subtle winged look. Of course, if they’re feeling glam and ditching the ‘no makeup makeup look”, they might indulge in false eyelashes for a doll-eye look.
How to get a Japanese eye makeup look
Depending on the specific Japanese makeup look you are seeking, a simple google search will reveal a plethora of different Japanese eye makeup tutorials and Japanese eyeliner makeup tutorials to choose from.
For a simple kawaii eye makeup look, dust a shimmery eyeshadow all over the lid and under the outer corner. Opt for soft shimmery colors like pinks, corals, peaches, beiges, and browns. Since the kawaii look is meant to be girly and cute, you’ll want to stay away from tones that are flamboyant, bright, or dark. Apply a slightly lighter color to the inner corners of the eyes. For example, if you used a rosey pink as your starter color, pop the inner corners with a white gold or light peach. The combinations here are endless, but the idea is to open the eyes and make them look as doll-like as possible.
Next, draw liquid eyeliner in black or brown that is visibly thicker towards the outer corner. You can line the entire upper lash line or leave off a small section in the inner corner, depending on how bold you want to make it. The wing should stand out, but avoid making it too sharp, edgy and cat-like. It should have a slightly upward yet droopy effect. For an ultimate doll-look, use the same liquid eyeliner on just the outer corner of the lower lash line. You can also skip the lower lash line altogether or fill it in with a neutral or light-colored tone. Again, the idea is to make the eyes appear bigger.
Then, fill in your eyebrows with a natural shade that complements your hair color, and fluff them with a brush. Lastly, apply black mascara, and deliberately clump the lashes together into groups in a doll-like fashion. This can take some practice, so if you want to master Japanese style makeup right away, go straight for Japanese false eyelashes and your kawaii look is complete.  
Lips
For everyday makeup, Japanese people opt for nudes and pink shades, but they may experiment with bold reds and bright hues for going-out and special occasions. They also tend to fill the entire lip with color and skip the lipliner for a softer look. Japanese lip looks tend to be gloss heavy, and don’t usually involve complicated techniques like ombre and gradient. For a simple kawaii lip look, all you need is glossy lipstick, tinted lip balm, or lip gloss. Think plump and pouty.
Blush
Unlike American blush, which is applied along the cheekbone to create a healthy and sculpted look, the Japanese usually apply blush to the apples of their cheeks for a youthful appearance. Bright colors, especially coral and pink tones are especially popular with young women, and they’re not afraid to let it show. Nudes are popular with more mature women.
Japanese makeup brushes
Talk about Japanese makeup wouldn’t be complete without a word on the makeup tools used to achieve the various looks. Japan is well-known for its handcrafted luxury makeup brushes, and many high-end makeup brushes of overseas designer brands are made in Japan. The Kumano region of Japan is famed for its artisans who handmake soft, durable, and high-performing brushes based on centuries-old calligraphy brush craftsmanship or fude expertise. This makes Japanese makeup brushes among the most distinguished and respected in the beauty industry.
The final look of Japanese and western makeup can be as different as night and day. Now that you’ve got a crash course in J-Beauty natural makeup, try playing with these ideas and see what changes make the biggest impact!

When it comes to Asian eye makeup all the rules that you know fly out of the window. Mostly because of that, many women decide to go only with eyeliner or makeup-free. Even though Asian women are known for flawless skin, they like to experiment with eyeshadows.
The talk about Asian eyes is not new. On the contrary, it dates back centuries. People use to describe Asian eyes as nuts (particularly almonds). They are quite specific, but also very beautiful.

Two main characteristics of the Asian or almond eyes are eyelids and epicanthic folds. The epicanthic fold represents the skin on the upper lid, near the inner corner of the eye. These two things are the main reason why Asian women have trouble when doing their makeup. Trying to make their eyes look bigger is one of the biggest challenges.

Asian Eye Makeup Tutorial
When it comes to Asian eye makeup techniques and Asian eyeshadows the rule is the same for all – choose the style, technique, and shade that suits you. It will truly make a difference, and you will feel fabulous.
#1: Products You Need
It is essential to find and to stick to the beauty products that are good for your skin, and that goes well with your skin tone. The first thing is to find your perfect eyeshadow color. It can be earth-toned or vivid – as long as you feel good when you put it on your eyelids, it is ideal for you.
The second product that you must have in every situation is black eyeliner. Asian makeup almost always includes eyeliner, and that is why you should learn how to apply it in the best possible way.
The last, but not least is mascara. Along with the eyeliner, mascara will make your eyes pop! These two products go perfectly in a pair, and they will be your primary weapon for no-makeup makeup days!
#2: Best Eyeshadow Palette For Asian Eyes
When it comes to choosing the best palette for Asian eyes, we have to mention that there are no boundaries here. One rule applies for all women when picking eyeshadows – try to match it with your skin tone and color of your eyes.
If you are a beginner, it is the safest to use neutral, earth tones that will not be too eye-catching. The Asians usually have the warm skin complexion undertone so it will be easier for you to find the right brown or nude shade.
Always keep a red lipstick and brows shadow in your bag – with these products your makeup will be a head-turner. Here are some eyeshadow palettes you should keep in your beauty bag:
L.A. Girl Beauty Brick Eyeshadow, Nudes – This lovely nude palette is perfect for everyday Asian eye makeup. It has shimmery and matte shadows, which make it perfect for combining. Pinkish tones will match perfectly with any skin tone.
For perfect smokey eyes, you should have a palette that has darker colors and better pigment. From matte black to shimmery white, Maybelline New York The Rock Nudes Palette will serve you fantastic when you need to look fabulous.
Maybelline SuperStay Matte Ink Liquid Lipstick – choose this perfect red lipstick and make it stay on your lips all day long. With these matte creamy formulas, your lips will look fantastic. Don’t worry about the time – this lipstick can last up to 16 hours.
#3: How To Put Eyeshadow On Asian Eyes
Whether it is an eyeshadow palette for every day or more sophisticated and elegant occasions, you need to know how to apply it and blend it perfectly. Let’s see how to blend eyeshadow, even if you are not so good at it.
Jennifer Chiu is an amazing makeup artist that will show you some pro tips and tricks when it comes to blending your eye shadow. She does this tutorial very slow – it is detailed, and perfect for beginners.
Nude Eyeshadow Goes As A Base
This step is usually the same when you start doing your makeup. Start with a primer and nude eyeshadow as a base. Use the light white or creamy eyeshadow to the eye bone to visually lift up your eye.
Blending and Creating a Crease
After making a base, you need to apply the dark eyeshadow. The trick with the mongoloid and hooded eyes is to start on the outer corners of your eyes and then wing it up. Blend your eyeshadow towards the middle of your lid.
If you want to make your eye pop, take the dark eyeshadow a bit higher and then create a crease. Also, if you want your makeup to look heavier, and your crease to be darker, add more eyeshadow.
Making Beautiful Gradient
Using the patting motion, apply light and shimmery eyeshadow to the inner parts of your eyelid. By doing this, you will create a beautiful gradient.
For the end, apply dark brown or black eyeshadow to the outer corners just a bit more. Drag the shadow to the inner part of the eye to get more depth. Don’t forget lower lashline.
#4: How To Apply Eyeliner
Asian girls use eyeliner to make their eyes look more significant than usual. It is not easy work putting on the eyeliner. But you can learn to do it step by step. And, guess what? It is a beginner-friendly!
A young YouTuber Jessica Wu made a fantastic guide on how to apply eyeliner if you have flat hooded eyes. It is for beginners, and full of excellent makeup tips.
By the way, there’s a useful guide on wikiHow about how to determine your eye shape.

First Comes the Primer
The eye primer will help your eyeshadow to stay on your eyelids all day long. If you are planning to go to some event that requires elegant attire and heavier makeup, make sure to use it before applying eyeshadow or eyeliner.
It is on you to put or not to put some neutral eyeshadow. It can look nice if you want to contour your eye, but if you are a beginner, it might be a better choice to concentrate on your eyeliner.
Make a Base
First of all, you need to make a base for your eyeliner. By using a brush tip eyeliner, you will avoid the mistakes. Otherwise, you can mess up your eyeshadow and primer if you decide to start with some other type of eyeliner.
Remember – gel eyeliner is only for pros in this step! Always start with the top of your eyelid and create a good base. Don’t let it overlap with the crease – it can look pretty messy while your eyeliner will seem too thick.
Then, you should create an angle and connect it to the top to get the bottom of your wing.
Fill In Everything
When you finish with the base, you can switch to some more pigmented eyeliner to fill in everything. Don’t forget to fill in the lashline.
In the end, all you need to do is to finish off this look with the great black mascara.
#5: Putting the Finishing Touches: Powder, Mascara And More
The first step to finishing your eye makeup is to apply translucent powder on top of your eyeshadow or eyeliner if you think it may be in danger of smudging. If you have particularly oily lids, this is a great preventative measure to take. If you’ve never had a problem with eye makeup smudging, feel free to skip this step.
Next, you’ll want to address your lashes. If you have an eyelash curler, curl your lashes before applying mascara. Asians normally have naturally straight eyelashes, so curling them can make them appear more visible. You can even use a heated eyelash curler for a more dramatic effect.
If you like to wear mascara, apply to the top and bottom lashes. You can use a combination of 2 different mascaras to get big, voluminous lashes. If you don’t like the feeling of traditional mascara, try a fiber mascara.
If you really want to take your lash game to the next level, consider applying false eyelashes. You can choose between a strip of false lashes that goes over your entire lash line or individual falsies that you can apply just at the outer corner or anywhere else you desire. False eyelashes will make your eyes look bigger, so if your eyes are on the smaller side, they’re worth giving a shot.
To apply, dab a bit of eyelash glue onto your hand. Then, using tweezers or your fingers, carefully pick up a thin layer product on the lash band of the eyelashes. Apply as close to your lash line as you possibly can and wait for the glue to dry. Be sure to invest in a good quality eyelash glue if you don’t want to have to fuss with your eyelashes the whole day!
#6: Completing the Natural Asian Look: Brows and Blush
To make your natural makeup look complete, you’ll want your brows to be well-groomed. Most of the time, the brows in this makeup style are kept very straight. This look isn’t about creating a high, unnatural arch. If your brows are naturally arched, don’t worry – keep them as they are. Everyone’s eyebrows are different – the important thing is to keep them looking neat and tidy.
If you need to fill in any sparse areas, go ahead and do so. The best brush for applying eyebrow products is a small angled brush, but if you’re in a pinch you can use any eyeshadow brush you have on hand. For our natural look, use a soft powder or pencil a shade slightly lighter than your natural color (often a dark brown or gray) and lightly define your eyebrows.
Some people have thick brows and won’t need to do this step. Others may need to draw or extend their brows, while others still may just need to brush them into place using a gel or pomade.
Lastly, add some healthy color to your cheeks. This should be a light, natural flush – save the hot pink for a different type of look. If you are very pale, consider a peach colored blush. Otherwise, a wash of subtle pink will make you look healthy and youthful.
Asian Eye Makeup Instructions For Different Eye Types And Looks
Large Visible Lids or Double Eyelids
The standard natural Asian makeup look involves a shimmery eyeshadow shade that’s not too different from your skin tone, whether that’s a champagne, beige, copper, or rose color. This can be applied all over the lid after primer for a no-fuss, fresh-faced look. If you want, you can follow this up with some black or brown eyeliner. If not, skip right to mascara.
If you’ve got enough lid space, the standard way to apply eyeliner is to apply your pencil, gel, or liquid eyeliner as close to the lash line as you can in an even line across your lid. If you want a cat-eye shape, you can apply a wing. To do this, try to visualize your lower lash line extending towards the tail of your eyebrow.
Slowly extend your bottom lash line towards the tip of your eyebrow. Do the same from your top lash line, continuing your existing line. You should be creating a triangle with the tip pointing towards your eyebrow. After you’re satisfied with your wing, fill in the triangle.
You should then have a fabulous cat eye! You can also use eyeliner (with optional smudging) on top of a shimmery neutral shadow for a smokier eyeliner look.
Almond or Narrow-shaped Eyes
If your eyes are almond shaped or are on the thinner side (similar to Lucy Liu’s), try a mini cat eye. With your eyeliner of choice, create a small flick on the outer corner of your eyes after lining the lid. To make your eyes really pop, use white or peach eyeliner on your waterline.
For eyeshadow, a lighter shade will open up your eyes. Don’t be afraid to apply your eyeshadow well beyond the mobile lid if you don’t have a ton of lid space.
Monolid Or Hooded Eyes
If you have little or no visible lid space and/or lack a visible crease, you’ll want to create an eyeliner or eyeshadow shape that covers an area that’s bigger than just your mobile lid. Instead, you will take your desired eyeshadow all the way from your lid up into your crease and even slightly on your brow bone. The shape of your eyeshadow should be rounded on top and end in a wing or triangle shape in your outer corner.
Pro tip: use a piece of tape on the side of your eye (at an angle to your lower lash line) to keep the shadow in a nice, neat line. When you’re done applying your eyeshadow, remove the tape for a clean eyeshadow shape.
To apply eyeliner to eyes with little to no visible lid, mark the spot in which you want the eyeliner to be visible with a small dot or dash of eyeliner. The key is to do with while your eyes are still open. When your eyes are closed, use this dot to create an outline of where you will color in your eyeliner. You can use pencil, but it might smudge, so gel or liquid eyeliner may be the way to go.
Let your eyeliner set for around 30 seconds before closing your eyes so it doesn’t transfer to your crease. Then, go over this line as many times as you want, depending on the level of thickness you want your eyeliner to be. It may seem ridiculous with your eyes closed, but once your eyes are open, it will look flawless. You can do this technique with eyeshadow or just standalone eyeliner.
Pro tip: you can layer eyeliner pencil and eyeshadow for a cool new shade.
Downturned Eyes
The outer corner of the eye is lower than the inner corner of the eye.
Easy eye makeup to do is what’s called the puppy eye. It’s similar to the cat eye, but instead of going upwards, the eyeliner flicks downwards. After lining your lash line, you’ll want to draw a small triangle on the outer corner of your eye, almost in a cat-ear shape.
The triangles should be slanted outwards and go beyond your eyelid, into your lower lash line.
The Korean Aegyo-sal Look

If you like, you can try a Korean look called aegyo-sal, or eye-smiles. This involves accentuating your under-eye area. All you need is a soft, matte brown eyeshadow and a light, shimmery highlight shade. The idea is to essentially contour your under-eye area using shadow and highlight to give the appearance of more defined eye bags. Many say that this gives you a cuter, more youthful appearance or can make your eyes look rounder, but you’ll just have to try it out for yourself to decide!
The first step to getting this look is to take a matte brown powder that’s slightly darker than your skin tone (it can be eyeshadow, bronzer, eyebrow powder, or even a brown eyeliner) and apply it below your lash line with a small brush to where your existing eye bags are. If you don’t have any, apply them to the area in the photo to imitate natural eye bags. Be sure to follow the natural curve of your eye.
Once you’ve done this, blend out the line with a blending brush or a Q-tip so that the line is not so harsh. Next, take an eyeshadow slightly lighter than your skin tone and apply it to the area just below your lash line. If you have highlighter or a light, shimmery eyeshadow, you can apply this to the fullest part of your under-eye area. Blend it out so the transition from brown to shimmer is seamless, and you’ve got your ayego-sal look finished!
Smokey Eyes For Asian Eyes
One of the most popular techniques when it comes to makeup is definitely the smokey eye. From the classic ones in black and grey shades to the vivid ones, all women have tried it even once in their lifetime.
When it comes to hooded and Asian eyes, the smokey might seem a bit complicated because of the specific eyelids. However, if you see this video, you will see it is not so hard, but you have to follow some rules.

Apply Transitional Eyeshadow
Apply your primer, nude base and light eyeshadow to your brow bone.
If you are doing a darker smokey eye, use the primer that has brown or grey color. Pick the transition shade and apply it all over your eyelids.
Then you should use bit darker shade for outer corners. This is the beginning of creating depth. The trick is to apply it above the crease line so it will not disappear when you open your eye.
The Youtuber Tina Yong suggests using matte colors when you are in this step.
It’s Time for Darker Colors
When you are done with applying transitional shade (and make sure it is on the right spot), then it is time for darker colors. Place it with the outer corner of your eye and pull it above the crease that you have. Asian women used to put the dark shadow a bit above the crease to create depth. Try to drag this darker color to the inner part of the eye.
Apply Shimmery Shades
Now, you can choose the shimmery shades – they go perfectly in the corners and central eyelid.
While keeping the shade under the hood, apply whatever shimmer and shiny shade you like to the corner of your eye, and then to the central eyelid.
Don’t forget your lower lash line – apply the shadows that you have used in the first step. For the end, apply the black eyeliner and voila! All that you need to do now is to make your eyes pop with mascara.
Special Case: Asian Bridal Makeup
For the most important in your life, we recommend using long-lasting makeup products. Asian wedding makeup is nothing different than the usual. Asian women like to go classy, with smokey eyes and in darker brown tones.
This makeup for a wedding is not only easily achievable but also the result is impressive. However, make sure to use waterproof products – crying at your wedding is inevitable, but you need to look nice all day long.
Tina Yong shows us how to achieve glam, but not overdone look for a wedding. If you have almond eyes, you should follow her rules.
Hide All the Imperfections
You can start this makeup look with the primer, then concealer to hide your imperfections. Makeup artists use concealer as a contour product as well so you can try it too. Rolling motions will help you blend the concealer into your lower lash line.
Contouring is popular among Asian women, so blend your shades nicely. Don’t forget – you will take a lot of photos, so try to make contour shades less obvious!
Creating a Base and Crease
Start your eye makeup with the base color. If you have decided to stay in neutral beige and brown colors, then the base should be white or nude.
Then use warmer tones from your palette to make a crease. Blend it back and forward, using the wiper motion. With dark shade create v-shape or triangle in the inner corner of your eye. This will help you elongate your eye.
Maybelline has a small tutorial about creating a cut crease which is worth checking out.
Eyeliner is Optional
Since this is makeup for the wedding, you can allow yourself to use more shimmer eyeshadows, than for an everyday makeup look. You can apply shiny eyeshadow to your middle lid and inner corners of your eyes. Putting the eyeliner is optional.
If you want to go with full makeup on, then draw a thin line and put on false lashes. However, if you like to go more minimal, apply your favorite mascara (once again – waterproof!), and you are ready.
Natural Asian Makeup

Just a couple of words about natural makeup. Natural Asian makeup is covered in more depth in a separate article: 4 Tips To Achieve Flawless Natural Asian Makeup. Check it if you want to master natural makeup look.
For no-makeup makeup kind of days, you should moisturize your skin, put on a good foundation, and do a little contouring. The trick is to blend it all well so you can get that healthy glow.
When it comes to Asian eye makeup, you can work with one shadow only and apply the black eyeliner. Pink or nudes tones for your lips are a perfect everyday choice.
Dasha Kim does her everyday makeup in a few simple steps. She recommends good moisturizing, and she mentions that finding the right foundation for your skin tone is really important.
The truth is that mongoloid eyes are a bit more complicated to work with.
However, no matter how challenging it is, try to make your eyeliner line perfect and your smokey eyes glamorous. The results will amaze you, and it will push you to be more and more precise and creative.
Hooded eyes look so beautiful! We hope these tutorials and tips will help you to achieve your perfect look.

Perfecting Your Face Beat

1. To sop up oil and refresh makeup, lightly mist your face with toner, then pat with a tissue, says Eva Scrivo, makeup artist and owner of the eponymous New York City salon. Finish with a dusting of loose powder.
2. For a modern take on luminous skin, try pearlized pink-sand shades on lids and cheeks. With a pale matte mouth, you'll look rock-club cool (and not too disco). Pair pink lids with a natural, understated face.
3. The best way to make a makeup change is to choose the feature you get complimented on most, and play it up with a color that's the opposite of what you normally wear. Like neutrals? Go for color. Like color? Try earth tones.

4. Instead of shading hollows of your face, switch to highlighting. Using paler hues, accentuate under the brows for a mini lift, and dust a lighter blush along the cheekbone to plump cheeks.
5. To keep eye shadow from creasing (unless you're going for a cut crease look), eliminate as much oil as possible from your lids. Use an eye shadow base or pressed powder before applying color. Looser, more powdery shadows are best.
Maintaining Cara Delevingne-esque Brows

1. Overzealous tweezing can lead to emaciated brows and bald patches, where hair only grows back irregularly. Use a protein-spiked brow gel to stimulate healthy growth and brow fillers to shade in problem areas.
2. Full brows have been spotted on all the runways and are the hottest trend right now. Keep unruly brows looking polished with a slick of clear brow gel. Dab highlighter directly under the brow bone—you'll achieve an instant eye-lift effect!
3. The space between your eyebrows should be equal to the width of your eyes, and start where they line up with your nostrils. Follow our complete brow guide from Glamsquad expert Kelli Bartlett here, from shaping to plucking and trimming.
Concealing Skin Imperfections Like a Pro

1. Concealer is only half the battle when it comes to fixing flaws. To perfect your complexion (no matter the skin tone), try lipstick in a warm pink. ""It distracts from blemishes and other imperfections,"" says makeup artist Morgen Schick.
2. Trying to look well rested when you aren't? Avoid piling on the foundation. Use a tinted moisturizer instead, followed by a beige eye pencil—it counteracts any redness around your eyes.
3. Large pores are caused by two things: genetics and age. Want to shrink them? Go to a dermatologist or a spa to get microdermabrasion treatments, a type of facial that gently sloughs off the dead surface layer of skin.
4. When covering up blemishes, select a color for what you're concealing. For example, orange-tinged concealers counteract blueish under-eye circles. A green concealer hides redness. The idea is that concealers act as neutralizers.
5. Even if you didn't get enough sleep last night, nothing wakes up a face like bright cheek color. Consider a cream blush with red or pink overtones. Blend and taper into the apples of your cheeks and set with loose powder.
Preventing Blemishes Before They Start
(Image credit: Archive)
1. Identify blemish patterns on your face. Look at the way you hold the telephone, whether you sleep more on one side of your face or if you hold your head up with one hand when sitting. Try to avoid doing these things.
2. Go easy on the foundation. Makeup used to cover up pimples tends to clog pores and cause more blemishes. Try using a concealer with a zit-zapping ingredient like salicylic acid.
3. Breaking out? Use a deep-cleansing mask or chemical face peel once a week to rid your skin of impurities and dead skin cells that may be clogging pores. Make sure you're using the right type of mask for your skin type.
4. Don't forget to moisturize! The best way to prevent skin from overproducing oil, explains Erica Suppa—research scientist and founder of Fresh Faced Skincare—is to use a good moisturizer to balance out water and oil levels.
Accentuating Your Eyes

1. To accentuate your upper lash line without creating spidery fringe, apply a strip of false lashes meant for your lower lashes from corner to corner. They're shorter than traditional falsies, so they'll thicken your lash line without elongating too much.
2. Keep your eyes open when applying liquid liner—otherwise your line will look uneven. Apply by drawing three dashes, one on the corner, in the middle, and on the inside corner of your eye. Then go back and connect the dashes for a smooth line.
3. Want to make your small eyes look bigger? Stay away from dark eyeshadows. Start with a nude base, then apply shadow a shade or two darker than the base to your crease and use your finger to blend the color up toward your eyebrow.
4. When applying fake eyelashes, put a little more glue on the edges than the rest of the lash, since they're more likely to come loose. Blow on the glue for a few seconds for a better hold.
5. To copy the bevy of celebs sporting smoldering eyes on the red carpet, stay away from blue hues, which can make you look like you have under-eye circles. Instead, go for black, gray, brown, or—if you want ""color""—dark green shadows and liners.
Plumping Your Lips

1. For full lips go for a glossy look. Try first outlining the perimeter of your lips using a concealer brush dipped in bronzer two shades deeper than your skin tone. Then, top pout with gold, peach, or coral gloss.
2. When your lips look larger, it helps to slim your face down. The best way to beef up your mouth is to dab a shimmery gloss in the middle of your lower lip (on top of a lip-tone lipstick or gloss).
3. Play up your pout— it reminds people you're no pushover—with a deep, dramatic lipstick. Use your finger for a personally stamped finish. Highlight the area above your bow with a brush of gold eyeshadow.
Moisturizing Dry and Inflamed Skin

1. Rose and lavender work wonders in calming skin inflammation, according to Michele VanLandingham, ingredient information specialist for Dr. Hauschka Skin Care. Olive oil is also a great cure for all things dry, including peeling cuticles.
2. Prevent dead-skin pileup by using a pumice stone in the shower—and don't be tempted into using a razor. That will only cause more skin to grow back. Pamper your feet with moisturizing facial masks.
3. Lance Etchison, skin-care aesthetician at Bluemercury in Washington, D.C., suggests incorporating one new product at a time. ""And, since most active ingredients take effect over time, don't give up if you don't see immediate results,"" he advises.
4. For daytime moisturizing, think layering: Use an antioxidant serum under a face cream, topped off with sunblock. To prevent flaking, consider light exfoliation once a week. Moisturizing without exfoliating first can result in breakouts and dull skin.
5. Water, paper, chemicals: all dry up soft hands. ""You have to fight back every day,"" says Jan Arnold, founder of Creative Nail Design. ""Exfoliate to slough off dead cells, then slather on a rich cream to compensate for how few oil glands you have.""
6. Here's a secret for super-smooth, quenched lips: Use your richest eye cream on your lips! Note: Be sure it's a ""hydrating"" formula, not ""firming""—which is code for drying.
7. Sure, it's chilly in the morning, but don't be tempted to crank up the heat in the shower. Hot water followed by cool, dry air leads to rough skin. To lock in moisture post-shower, pat yourself dry, and coat skin in an alpha-hydroxy lotion.
8. For flawless skin choose a cleanser and moisturizer appropriate for your skin type that you can use a.m. and p.m., and then supplement it weekly with a purifying face mask. Also, consider using a nightly skin treatment that exfoliates dead skin cells.
Optimizing Your Nail Care

1. We love the look of a perfect sheer manicure on long, tapered talons as much as the next woman, but who's got the time? For equally elegant, less fussy nails, go short, round, and dark. File your nails so they line up with the tips of your fingers and round the corners.
2. Low on cash but still want to indulge? Pamper your feet. If you're going to indulge in any spa treatment, go for a pedicure. It costs more than a manicure (though much less than a body treatment), and it lasts for weeks.
3. For those using sunscreen and bug spray in the summer, Grete Olsen of Frenchies Modern Nail Care recommends wiping it off your nails after applying. ""The chemicals in those products can break down the top coat and polish, shortening the wear of the manicure.""
4. In order to make sure that your nail polish lasts longer, Autumn Munter of Frenchies Modern Nail Care recommends applying glitter nail polish on top for a longer-lasting finish that will also add a hint of sparkle.
5. Rae Getter of Frenchies Modern Nail Care also recommends applying cuticle oil (she loves the Zeva Nails Pen) to help keep nails hydrated and hang nail-free. "" Dry nails don't flex, so polish will chip more easily"" without the extra hydration, she says.
Creating a Natural-Looking Glow

1. Naturally pale but want a healthy glow? The good news is that you don't need a lot of makeup to achieve great-looking skin, says New York makeup artist Paula Dorf. For natural-looking results, apply glow products to the apples of your cheeks, the bridge of your nose, your hairline, and chin.
2. Sidestep streaks by mixing self-tanner with moisturizer before applying. This dilutes the formula so you achieve a more natural, less stripe-like effect. See our guide for the best no-streak self-tanners here.
3. To avoid an orange-y look with self-tanner, after application, wipe a cotton swab or a damp paper towel across your eyebrows and along your hairline.
Counteracting Wrinkles

1. Treating your neck like your face doesn't work. ""Your neck ages in its own way and so has special needs,"" explains Adrienne Denese, M.D., Ph.D. ""Neck tendons shrink over time and become more visible, so the thin skin in this area doesn't respond to lasers and peels as well as your face does."" She suggests good posture and neck stretches.
2. ""I frequently see women with deeper wrinkles on one side of their face—the side they sleep on, of course,"" says New York dermatologist Heidi A. Waldorf. To avoid ""sleep lines,"" opt for silk or satin pillowcases and pile on the antiaging products.
3. Avoid prolonged sun exposure! Says derm Dr. Sameer Bashey, not only do the sun's rays cause skin cancer, but also photo aging. Steer clear of direct contact with the sun during peak hours (between 10 a.m. and 3 p.m.) and nix tanning beds for good.
4. Use Retin-A or retinol regularly. ""Vitamin A-derived creams are known to prevent fine lines and wrinkles. However they only help with fine lines and not deep wrinkles from volume loss. Retin-A or retinol need to be used as part of a comprehensive skin care program to rejuvenate skin,"" says Bashey.
